Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350–51 (1989).\\n\\n        Rather, it prescribes a process to ensure that federal decisionmakers consider, and the\\n\\n        public is informed about, the potential environmental consequences of federal actions. Id.\\n\\n               To accomplish this goal, NEPA directs federal agencies to prepare an\\n\\n        Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) for any “major Federal action[] significantly\\n\\n        affecting the quality of the human environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). But an agency\\n\\n        may first prepare an Environmental Assessment (“EA”) to determine whether the proposed\\n\\n        action will have a significant impact requiring the preparation of an EIS. 40 C.F.R.\\n\\n        §§ 1501.4, 1508.9. Determining whether environmental impacts will be “significant”\\n\\n        requires consideration of “both the context of the action and the intensity, or severity, of\\n\\n        the impact.” Ohio Valley Env’t Coalition, 556 F.3d at 191 (citing 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(a)).\\n\\n        The relevant regulations list several factors an agency should consider in evaluating\\n\\n        intensity,1 including:\\n\\n                        “[u]nique characteristics of the geographic area such as\\n                        proximity to historic or cultural resources, . . . wetlands, wild\\n                        and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas”; the potential\\n                        for “loss or destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or\\n                        historical resources”; the “degree to which the effects on the\\n                        quality of the human environment are likely to be highly\\n                        controversial”; the “degree to which the possible effects on the\\n                        human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or\\n                        unknown risks”; and “[t]he degree to which the action may\\n                        adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or its\\n                        habitat that has been determined to be critical under [the\\n                        ESA].”\\n\\n\\n\\n               1\\n                   As we discuss below, Appellants’ arguments relate to these intensity factors.\\n\\n                                                       4\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 5 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b) (2020).2\\n\\n               If the agency determines that the impacts of its action will not be significant (or will\\n\\n        be mitigated below the level of significance), the agency issues a finding of no significant\\n\\n        impact in lieu of preparing an EIS. See Ohio Valley Env’t Coalition, 556 F.3d at 191–92\\n\\n        (citation omitted).

When formal consultation is\\n\\n        required, the Service issues a Biological Opinion (“BiOp”) addressing whether the action\\n\\n        is likely to cause jeopardy. Id. § 1536(c).\\n\\n               Section 9 of the ESA broadly prohibits the “take” of any listed species. 16 U.S.C.\\n\\n        § 1538(a)(1)(B). To “take” means to “harass, harm, . . . wound, [or] kill, . . . or to attempt\\n\\n        to engage in any such conduct.” Id. § 1532(19). If the Service concludes that the proposed\\n\\n        agency action is not likely to cause jeopardy but will nonetheless “take” members of a\\n\\n        listed species, the Service must provide an Incidental Take Statement (“ITS”) with the\\n\\n\\n               2\\n                 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27 was recently amended and recodified at 40 C.F.R. § 1501.3.\\n        This change does not meaningfully impact our analysis as the parties contend the regulation\\n        in effect at the time of agency decisions underlying this appeal applies.\\n\\n                                                      5\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942       Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025        Pg: 6 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        BiOp. The ITS must specify the “amount or extent” of incidental take, “reasonable and\\n\\n        prudent” mitigation measures, and “terms and conditions” to implement those measures.\\n\\n        50 C.F.R. § 402.14(i)(1)(i)–(iv). The issuance of a valid ITS exempts the take from the\\n\\n        ESA’s take prohibition, so long as the take complies with the terms and conditions of the\\n\\n        ITS. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(4), (o); see also id. § 1538(a)(1)(B).\\n\\n               The ITS must specify “the amount or extent of anticipated take.” 50 C.F.R.\\n\\n        § 402.14(i)(1)(i) (emphasis supplied). If the project exceeds the level of anticipated take\\n\\n        provided in the ITS, consultation with the Service must be reinitiated. Id. § 402.16(a)(1).\\n\\n        Thus, in that way, the specified level of anticipated take serves as a reinitiation “trigger.”\\n\\n        Sierra Club v. United States Dep’t of Interior, 899 F.3d 260, 270 (4th Cir. 2018). That is,\\n\\n        the ITS is intended to be just that -- a statement of the incidental take anticipated due to the\\n\\n        agency action. Though we have sometimes referred to an ITS as a “take limit,” id., it is\\n\\n        not intended to set a “limit” lower than the actual anticipated take. Rather, the set level of\\n\\n        anticipated take serves as a “limit” only in the sense that if or when that level is exceeded,\\n\\n        reinitiation of consultation with the Service is triggered.\\n\\n               The level of anticipated take generally must be expressed as the number of\\n\\n        individuals that will be taken. But the Service may use a surrogate measure, such as the\\n\\n        quantity of affected habitat, if “it is not practical to express the amount or extent of\\n\\n        anticipated take or to monitor take-related impacts in terms of individuals of the listed\\n\\n        species.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(i)(1)(i) (emphasis supplied); see also 80 Fed.

This includes the 9,037 acre tract at issue in this\\n\\n        appeal -- Cainhoy. Intervenors have used Cainhoy as a pine tree timber farm for the last\\n\\n        90 years. In 1996, the city of Charleston, South Carolina, annexed Cainhoy into the city\\n\\n        limits. Charleston sought to have Intervenors develop Cainhoy to allow for growth in the\\n\\n        city.\\n\\n                Though Cainhoy totals over 9,000 acres, including over 2,500 acres of wetlands, the\\n\\n        proposed Cainhoy development will develop only 3,906 acres, including 181.5 acres of\\n\\n        wetlands.    The remaining acres are to be placed in conservation easements and/or\\n\\n        restrictive covenants to permanently protect the property. Cainhoy is planned to be a mixed\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                      7\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 8 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        used commercial and residential development, eventually containing 9,000 homes,\\n\\n        schools, city services, and a medical center.\\n\\n               To accomplish the goal of developing Cainhoy, Intervenors began applying for the\\n\\n        required permits in 2012. Relevant here, in 2018 Intervenors applied for a permit from the\\n\\n        Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act\\n\\n        because the project will impact wetlands -- in particular, the 181.5 acres of wetlands that\\n\\n        will be filled for development. In compliance with NEPA, the Corps completed an EA to\\n\\n        determine whether an EIS was required. And as part of its review, the Corps was required\\n\\n        to consult with the Service (together with the Corps, the “Federal Appellees”) to determine\\n\\n        whether the Cainhoy development project is “likely to jeopardize the continued existence”\\n\\n        of a threatened or endangered species. 16 U.S.C. § 1536. Specifically, the Corps evaluated\\n\\n        the Cainhoy development’s impact on the northern long-eared bat (“NLEB”), which was\\n\\n        then listed as threatened, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.\\n\\n               The Service issued an initial BiOp in 2018, which determined that the project was\\n\\n        not likely to jeopardize the NLEB or the red-cockaded woodpecker. Then, in 2022, after\\n\\n        four years of environmental review, the Corps completed its EA and concluded that issuing\\n\\n        the Section 404 permit would not have any significant environmental impacts after\\n\\n        accounting for mitigation measures, so no EIS was required.\\n\\n               In completing the EA, the Corps coordinated with other state and federal agencies,\\n\\n        participated in community meetings, and solicited and responded to public comments about\\n\\n        the Cainhoy development project. Of all the entities involved, only one requested that the\\n\\n        Corps complete an EIS. That request came from the lead plaintiff, Appellant South\\n\\n                                                        8\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52         Filed: 01/31/2025    Pg: 9 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Carolina Coastal Conservation League. The Corps denied this request based upon its\\n\\n        conclusion that the EA was legally sufficient. Therefore, the Corps issued the Section 404\\n\\n        Permit, allowing Intervenors to fill 181.5 acres of wetlands, on May 11, 2022. Work on\\n\\n        the Cainhoy development began at that time.\\n\\n              Appellants filed this lawsuit in the District of South Carolina on August 17, 2022,\\n\\n        alleging that the permit approval was unlawful because it violated NEPA and the ESA.\\n\\n        But in 2023, work on Cainhoy was paused, and the lawsuit stayed, while the Federal\\n\\n        Appellees reinitiated environmental review of the project because the NLEB had been\\n\\n        reclassified as an endangered species.\\n\\n              The NLEB has never been spotted in Cainhoy and was last documented about 8.5\\n\\n        miles away in the Francis Marion National Forest in 2019. As part of the reinitiated\\n\\n        consultation with the Service, Intervenors elected to presume the presence of NLEBs on\\n\\n        the Cainhoy property rather than conducting surveys to formally confirm or deny their\\n\\n        presence. Intervenors made this decision because they believed the cost and time of\\n\\n        surveys would render the project infeasible. The Service determined that presuming the\\n\\n        presence of the NLEB was acceptable given that the possible surveys would only have\\n\\n        confirmed or denied presence, rather than providing more useful data such as population\\n\\n        density. Thus, the Service determined that nothing about its review would change if there\\n\\n        had been a positive survey rather than a presumption of the NLEB’s presence.\\n\\n              In reviewing the Cainhoy development project to determine whether it would\\n\\n        jeopardize the existence of NLEBs, the Service determined that the project would remove\\n\\n        up to 3,906 acres of suitable roosting and foraging habitat. And it determined that the\\n\\n                                                    9\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942         Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 10 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        removal of habitat can result in the lethal and nonlethal take of NLEBs. While NLEBs in\\n\\n        South Carolina do not hibernate like bats in more northern states, they do take short winter\\n\\n        rests known as torpors. The Service thus determined that the highest risk of mortality to\\n\\n        NLEBs would be during the summer occupancy, from April 1 to July 15, and the winter\\n\\n        torpor period, from December 15 to February 15. Therefore, the Service restricted\\n\\n        Intervenors from conducting tree removal on 2,930 acres during those periods of time. As\\n\\n        to the remaining 976 acres of the Cainhoy development, the Service determined that those\\n\\n        acres would be cleared, if at all, when individual homeowners purchase plots in the future\\n\\n        and clear them for building. Because those acres would not be cleared all at once, but\\n\\n        rather in small increments over the 30 year permit term, the Service determined that they\\n\\n        could be cleared at any time of the year.\\n\\n               In addition, all tree clearing is subject to additional restrictions in order to minimize\\n\\n        impacts on NLEBs, including time of day restrictions to avoid feeding disruptions;\\n\\n        minimizing removal of snags (dead or dying trees) that are important to the species;\\n\\n        installing artificial roosts to supplement the loss of roosting habitat; complying with state\\n\\n        forestry best management practices; and yearly bat monitoring. With these restrictions, the\\n\\n        Service determined that “most incidental take [of NLEBs] will be non-lethal and\\n\\n        undetectable (e.g., bats fleeing disturbances caused by proposed activities, which creates\\n\\n        the likelihood of death or injury due to predation and reduced fitness).” J.A. 188.3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               3\\n                   Citations to the “J.A.” refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\\n\\n                                                         10\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 11 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               The Service also believed that any incidental take, lethal or not, would be difficult\\n\\n        to detect because (1) the bats are “small and occupy forested habitats”; (2) they form small,\\n\\n        widely dispersed colonies and may roost individually, sometimes under loose bark or in\\n\\n        tree cavities, making detection difficult; (3) finding dead or injured specimens was\\n\\n        unlikely; and, (4) bats are mostly nocturnal. J.A. 188. Therefore, the Service believed it\\n\\n        was “not practical to monitor take in terms of the number of individual[]” NLEBs affected.\\n\\n        Id.\\n\\n               Consequently, instead of setting a numerical limit on the number of individual\\n\\n        NLEBs that could be taken, the Service used the habitat acreage as a “surrogate.” The\\n\\n        Service determined that Intervenors anticipated taking up to 2,930 acres of habitat outside\\n\\n        of the sensitive seasons, and up to 976 acres of habitat during any time of year. Due to the\\n\\n        nature of the NLEBs and the small portion of available habitat the Cainhoy development\\n\\n        would remove -- 3,906 acres out of 12.86 million acres of forest in South Carolina -- the\\n\\n        Service “anticipate[d] that the displaced bats will relocate to the remaining forest land\\n\\n        within South Carolina,” J.A. 174, and determined that it did “not anticipate the neighboring\\n\\n        bat population to experience adverse effects.” Id. at 173.\\n\\n               After the Service provided this information to the Corps in a revised BiOP, the\\n\\n        Corps modified the Section 404 permit to incorporate the BiOp’s restrictions on tree\\n\\n        clearing. And the Corps revised the EA’s discussion of the potential impacts of the\\n\\n        Cainhoy development to account for the potential impact on NLEBs. Ultimately, the Corps\\n\\n        concluded that the EA, rather than an EIS, was still sufficient because the permit\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                     11\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942        Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 12 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        modification was “minor” and “will not result in significant individual or cumulative\\n\\n        impacts on the human environment.” J.A. 271.\\n\\n               Intervenors resumed development of Cainhoy in July 2024. Appellants then filed\\n\\n        an Amended Complaint and moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary\\n\\n        injunction on August 1, 2024, arguing that the Corps had acted arbitrarily and capriciously\\n\\n        by failing to publish an EIS and that the Service had acted arbitrarily and capriciously by\\n\\n        using a habitat surrogate to set the level of anticipated take in the ITS. After extensive\\n\\n        briefing and a hearing on the matter, the district court denied Appellants’ motion for a\\n\\n        preliminary injunction on September 19, 2024.             The district court concluded that\\n\\n        Appellants did not have a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits of their claims,\\n\\n        would not experience irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, and that the balance\\n\\n        of the equities did not fall in their favor.\\n\\n               Appellants timely noted this appeal.\\n\\n                                                        II.\\n\\n               “This Court reviews a district court’s denial of a motion for preliminary injunction\\n\\n        for abuse of discretion.” Di Biase v.

To obtain a preliminary\\n\\n        injunction, the movant must establish that (1) it is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) it is\\n\\n        likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of\\n\\n        equities tips in its favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest. See id. at 20.\\n\\n               The district court determined that Appellants were not likely to succeed on their\\n\\n        claims that (1) the Service violated the ESA by using a habitat surrogate in the ITS and (2)\\n\\n        the Corps violated NEPA by completing only an EA rather than an EIS.

United States Dep’t of Interior, 899 F.3d 260, 271 (4th\\n\\n        Cir. 2018). To use a surrogate, the Service must determine “it is not practical to express\\n\\n                                                       13\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 14 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        the amount or extent of anticipated take or to monitor take-related impacts in terms of\\n\\n        individuals of the listed species.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(i)(1)(i) (emphasis supplied). And it\\n\\n        must describe “the causal link between the surrogate and take” and set “a clear standard\\n\\n        for determining when the level of anticipated take has been exceeded.” Id.\\n\\n               In this case, the ITS set the amount of anticipated take as the 3,906 acres of habitat\\n\\n        the Cainhoy development is expected to impact. Explaining its decision to not use the\\n\\n        number of individual NLEBs impacted as the anticipated take, the Service stated that it\\n\\n        “anticipates incidental take of the NLEB . . . will be difficult to detect.” J.A. 188. It\\n\\n        provided the following reasons for this conclusion:\\n\\n               1. The individuals are small and occupy forested habitats where they\\n                  are difficult to find;\\n\\n               2. Bats form small, widely dispersed maternity colonies, some\\n                  species occur under loose bark or in the cavities of trees, and males\\n                  and non-reproductive females may roost individually, which\\n                  makes finding the species or occupied habitats difficult;\\n\\n               3. Finding dead or injured specimens during or following Action\\n                  implementation is unlikely;\\n\\n               4. Bats are mostly nocturnal; and\\n\\n               5. Most incidental take will be non-lethal and undetectable (e.g., bats\\n                  fleeing disturbances caused by proposed activities, which creates\\n                  the likelihood of death or injury due to predation and reduced\\n                  fitness).\\n\\n        Id.\\n\\n               Thus, because the Service determined that it was “not practical to monitor take in\\n\\n        terms of individuals of the listed species,” it used acres “of forested habitats removed based\\n\\n        on seasonality during the implementation of the action as surrogate measures for the\\n\\n                                                     14\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942       Doc: 52           Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 15 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        anticipated amount or extent of take caused” by the Cainhoy development. J.A. 188.\\n\\n               As to the causal connection between the acreage of habitat cleared and the take of\\n\\n        NLEBs, the ITS referred back to section 4.6.2 of the BiOp. Section 4.6.2 explained that\\n\\n        “[t]ree removal [for Cainhoy] will affect approximately 3,906 ac[res] of NLEB roosting\\n\\n        and foraging habitat.” J.A. 172. It explained that the habitat removal could result in\\n\\n        “potential injury or mortality of NLEB individuals” if they are roosting in trees that are\\n\\n        removed or due to the loss of “foraging, commuting, and roosting habitat.” Id. But it also\\n\\n        explained that “[t]he amount of mortality would not be determinable since dead NLEBs\\n\\n        would likely go unnoticed, and estimating such mortality is difficult since NLEB density\\n\\n        data is not available.” Id. at 173.\\n\\n               As to the potential for nonlethal harm to NLEBs, the Service explained that NLEBs\\n\\n        have the “ability to travel distances spanning further than the” Cainhoy development and\\n\\n        “will have flexibility of foraging habitat and breeding opportunity” outside of the acreage\\n\\n        to be cleared. J.A. 173. “This tree removal represents a small portion of foraging and\\n\\n        roosting habitat within the larger forest land available in South Carolina,” which the service\\n\\n        estimates to be approximately 12.86 million acres. Id. at 174. Thus, “due to their generalist\\n\\n        habits in roost selection and the abundance of forested lands, the potential adverse effects\\n\\n        are anticipated to be short-term as the bats will be able to relocate to other forest land within\\n\\n        South Carolina.” Id. The Service “anticipate[d] the displaced bats will relocate to the\\n\\n        remaining forest land within South Carolina,” id., and did “not anticipate the neighboring\\n\\n        bat population to experience adverse effects due to the [Cainhoy development].” Id. at\\n\\n        173.\\n\\n                                                       15\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942         Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 16 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                         2.\\n\\n                  Appellants argue that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that this\\n\\n        use of a habitat surrogate was unlawful because, in their view, it is not impractical for the\\n\\n        Service “to express the amount or extent of anticipated take” as a numeric value. 50 C.F.R.\\n\\n        § 402.14(i)(1)(i). Even if we determine that the use of a surrogate was proper, Appellants\\n\\n        further argue that the one utilized here fails because it did not sufficiently “[d]escribe[] the\\n\\n        causal link between the surrogate and take of the listed species,” or “set[] a clear standard\\n\\n        for determining when the level of anticipated take has been exceeded.” Id.\\n\\n                  In support of their arguments, Appellants rely heavily on our decision in Sierra\\n\\n        Club, 899 F.3d 260. As a result, we find it necessary to discuss that case in some depth\\n\\n        here. In Sierra Club, the Service used habitat surrogates for five listed species, including\\n\\n        the NLEB and the smaller Indiana Bat (“Ibat”). 899 F.3d at 274–81.\\n\\n                  To explain why it believed setting a number for the anticipated take of Ibats was\\n\\n        impractical, the Service provided reasoning similar to that offered here: “incidental take of\\n\\n        the Ibat will be difficult to detect for the following reasons: species has small body size,\\n\\n        finding a dead or impaired specimen is unlikely, and species occurs in habitat (forest and\\n\\n        caves) that makes detection difficult.” Sierra Club, 899 F.3d at 279 (citation and internal\\n\\n        quotation marks omitted).         Thus, the Service purported to use a habitat surrogate.\\n\\n        However, although the affected habitat was anticipated to be 4,447.982 acres, rather than\\n\\n        use that whole amount of acreage as the habitat surrogate, the Service, “without any\\n\\n        explanation . . . set the take limit . . . at half” of the anticipated acreage: 2,721.24 acres. Id.\\n\\n        at 279.\\n\\n                                                        16\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942         Doc: 52        Filed: 01/31/2025    Pg: 17 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                  In Sierra Club, we determined that the surrogate was improper for several reasons.\\n\\n        Relevant here, we held that the Service did not demonstrate that a numeric limit was\\n\\n        impractical: “The bats may be small, but [the Service] has been able to survey them in the\\n\\n        past. Indeed, [the Service] made precise estimates as recently as 2017, determining that\\n\\n        there are 425 bats in Virginia and 1,076 in West Virginia.” Sierra Club, 899 F.3d at 280.\\n\\n        Thus, we were not convinced that the small size of the Ibat was sufficient to render using\\n\\n        a numerical anticipated take impractical. We noted that the Service had been able to count\\n\\n        Ibats in other ITS’s, and there was no reason it could not do so in Sierra Club, even if it\\n\\n        was “difficult.” Id.\\n\\n                  Even if use of a surrogate had been proper, we determined that the one offered was\\n\\n        insufficient because it did not set an enforceable trigger. The purported habitat surrogate\\n\\n        provided that the anticipated take was a “small percent of individuals present within” half\\n\\n        the actual acreage of the project. Sierra Club, 899 F.3d at 278 (cleaned up). We explained\\n\\n        that it was “impossible to know what a ‘small percent’ of bats is” when there was no\\n\\n        numerical figure attached. Id. at 279. And we opined that the anticipated take surrogate\\n\\n        would still fail even if the Service removed the “small percent” language because the\\n\\n        Service “knows that the pipeline will exceed the geographic bounds” it set, and did not\\n\\n        explain why it believed the anticipated take was only half of the acreage of the project. Id.\\n\\n        at 280.\\n\\n                  Similarly, for the NLEB, the Service set the anticipated take in Sierra Club as “a\\n\\n        small percent of individuals present within 0.4 acres.” 899 F.3d at 281 (cleaned up)\\n\\n        (citation omitted). We held that the surrogate was invalid because the Service had “not\\n\\n                                                      17\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942       Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 18 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        shown that a numeric take limit is impractical in such a small geographic area,” and\\n\\n        “[a]lthough the geographic bounds are fixed, . . . it is impossible to know how many bats\\n\\n        constitute a ‘small percent.’” Id.\\n\\n               There was only one species where we agreed that the Service had demonstrated a\\n\\n        numerical anticipated take was impractical: the Madison Cave Isopod. Sierra Club, 899\\n\\n        F.3d at 277–78. The Isopod “is a half-inch crustacean that lives in underground aquifers.”\\n\\n        Id. at 278. We agreed that the Service could use a surrogate rather than a number of\\n\\n        individuals for the anticipated take because it “lacked the ability to survey the presence or\\n\\n        abundance of the isopods [and instead] assumed that they will be found in the pipeline\\n\\n        project area.” Id. at 277.\\n\\n               Significantly, we were careful to note, however, that for the other species, a lack of\\n\\n        surveys calculating the population density was insufficient where the Service “lacked\\n\\n        current survey information about many of the species or . . . had not completed the\\n\\n        necessary surveys.” Sierra Club, 899 F.3d at 272. Because the Service “‘never state[d]\\n\\n        that it is not possible’ to obtain or update the survey data and arrive at a numeric take limit,”\\n\\n        it could not “escape its statutory and regulatory obligations by not obtaining accurate\\n\\n        scientific information.” Id. (citations omitted)\\n\\n               Returning to this case, Appellants argue first, as they did in the district court, that\\n\\n        the habitat surrogate was improper because the Service did not demonstrate in the ITS that\\n\\n        it was impractical to determine the number of individual bats affected. Appellants point\\n\\n        out that the justifications offered for the use of a surrogate in the ITS here are similar to\\n\\n        those offered in Sierra Club: the bats are small and occupy forested habitats and finding\\n\\n                                                       18\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 19 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        dead or injured specimens is unlikely. And because those justifications were held to be\\n\\n        insufficient in Sierra Club where the agency had counted the number of bats previously,\\n\\n        Appellants argue that they must be insufficient here as well. Moreover, Appellants argue\\n\\n        that the fact that NLEBs have been counted in other cases4 to provide a numeric value for\\n\\n        the anticipated take is dispositive -- if they could be counted before, they must be counted\\n\\n        here, and the Service must require such counting and set a numerical anticipated take.\\n\\n               The Service counters, as it did below, that use of the surrogate is permissible here\\n\\n        because it properly determined that “it is not practical to . . . monitor take-related impacts\\n\\n        in terms of individuals.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(i)(1)(i) (emphasis supplied). In particular, it\\n\\n        points to its finding that “[m]ost incidental take will be non-lethal and undetectable.” J.A.\\n\\n        188. “Take may occur when bats flee tree-clearing and experience nonlethal reductions in\\n\\n        fitness or increased predation risk, which cannot be monitored or tracked.” Federal\\n\\n        Appellees’ Response at 20 (citing J.A. 140–41, 172–74, 184, 188).\\n\\n               The Service argues Sierra Club is not dispositive on this issue because the facts are\\n\\n        distinguishable, given the lack of hibernation of the subject NLEBs and the overall scope\\n\\n        of the Cainhoy Development. The Service further argues that the surrogate is proper\\n\\n        because it is not practical to estimate the number of individual NLEBs that will be taken.\\n\\n        Contrary to Appellants’ argument that the Service could have conducted surveys to\\n\\n        determine the likely population of NLEBs on the Cainhoy property, the Service explains\\n\\n\\n\\n               4\\n                Appellants point to Sierra Club, 899 F.3d at 280, and Defenders of Wildlife, Inc.\\n        v. United States Dep’t of Int., 931 F.3d 339, 360–63 (4th Cir. 2019).\\n\\n                                                     19\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 20 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        that the surveys available are only for the purpose of establishing probable presence or\\n\\n        absence of NLEBs. They are not for estimating population density. This differs from the\\n\\n        facts of Sierra Club where the bats were able to be counted in Virginia and West Virginia\\n\\n        because there was a hibernaculum5 within five miles of the project. 899 F.3d at 281. The\\n\\n        Service explains that when bats hibernate, they can be counted. But, because bats in coastal\\n\\n        South Carolina do not hibernate, the Service avers that is has no reliable methods to\\n\\n        determine population density or a specific number of bats that may be present.\\n\\n               In its opinion, the district court determined that Sierra Club was distinguishable\\n\\n        because of the known hibernaculum and the small area at issue there -- 0.4 acres. Because\\n\\n        there are no hibernacula in South Carolina and no NLEBs have been seen on the Cainhoy\\n\\n        property, and due to the size of the project area, the district court agreed with the Service\\n\\n        that Sierra Club was not applicable, let alone controlling here.6 The district court also\\n\\n        pointed out that Sierra Club was particularly concerned about the fact that the purported\\n\\n        habitat surrogates were limited to some “small percent” subset. 899 F.3d at 281. No such\\n\\n        concern exists here. Therefore, the district court determined that Appellants were not likely\\n\\n        to succeed on the merits of their claim that the use of a habitat surrogate was improper here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               5\\n                 A bat hibernaculum is a shelter, often a cave or mine, occupied by dormant bats\\n        during    the     winter     months.    See     Hibernaculum,      Merriam-Webster.com,\\n        https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hibernaculum           [https://perma.cc/32ZH-\\n        ZUFQ] (last visited Jan. 6, 2025).\\n               6\\n                The district court also noted that it was “struck” by the lack of “scientific support\\n        challenging the [BiOp].” J.A. 981.\\n\\n\\n                                                     20\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942       Doc: 52         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 21 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               Considering this reasoning, the district court did not abuse its discretion. Here, the\\n\\n        Service not only determined that it was impractical “to express the amount or extent of\\n\\n        anticipated take” in terms of the number of individual NLEBs, 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(i)(1)(i),\\n\\n        it also determined that it was “not practical to monitor take in terms of individuals of the\\n\\n        listed species,” because most of the take was expected to be “non-lethal and undetectable.”\\n\\n        J.A. 188. While Sierra Club did reject surrogate justifications similar to those here, the\\n\\n        BiOp and ITS are more specific in this case. They explain that the reason the take is\\n\\n        expected to be mostly nonlethal and undetectable is that NLEBs are expected to simply\\n\\n        “relocate to the remaining forest land within South Carolina,” id. at 174, and that any\\n\\n        nonlethal take experienced when a NLEB flees a tree and experiences “reduced fitness”\\n\\n        from having a travel farther to a new roost, id. at 188, is undetectable. That point is well\\n\\n        taken, particularly considering the fact that the 263,904-acre Francis Marion National\\n\\n        Forest is adjacent to Cainhoy, all of which is in a protected status.\\n\\n               Appellants protest that even if the use of a surrogate is proper here, the Service’s\\n\\n        proffered surrogate fails because it did not sufficiently “[d]escribe[] the causal link between\\n\\n        the surrogate and take of the listed species,” or “set[] a clear standard for determining when\\n\\n        the level of anticipated take has been exceeded.” 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(i)(1)(i). The district\\n\\n        court rejected these arguments and determined that the casual link described in the ITS was\\n\\n        sufficient because it explained that “tree removal will affect 3,906 ac[res] of NLEB\\n\\n        roosting and foraging habitat,” and that the takes expected would be caused by the tree\\n\\n        clearing activity. J.A. 1029–30; J.A. 172. As to whether the surrogate set a clear standard,\\n\\n        the district court determined that the habitat surrogate was enforceable because “reinitiation\\n\\n                                                      21\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942       Doc: 52         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 22 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        of consultation will be triggered if the project exceeds the anticipated 3,906 acres, if any\\n\\n        acreage is cleared within sensitive seasons, or if developers do not comply with the special\\n\\n        conditions of the [404] permit.” Id. at 1030.\\n\\n               Here, too, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The causal\\n\\n        link between the use of the acres of destroyed habitat and any incidental take of NLEBs is\\n\\n        clear. On its face, the ITS explains that “[i]n this case, the Service is using ac[res] of\\n\\n        forested habitats removed based on seasonality during the implementation of the action as\\n\\n        surrogate measures for the anticipated amount or extent of take caused by the proposed\\n\\n        Action.” J.A. 188. And the ITS points to Section 4.6 of the BiOp for further explanation.\\n\\n        That section explains that the consequences of habitat removal “include potential injury or\\n\\n        mortality of NLEB individuals roosting in trees that are removed, and loss of foraging,\\n\\n        commuting, and roosting habitat.” Id. at 172. It further explains that the “NLEB may be\\n\\n        injured or killed while fleeing disturbance . . . [and] [a]dditional effects may include\\n\\n        reduced fitness of NLEB individuals through additional energy expenditure while\\n\\n        searching for a new roost site, or a shift in home range.” Id. Additionally, the habitat\\n\\n        surrogate of 3,906 acres is sufficiently enforceable -- if Intervenors clear even one extra\\n\\n        acre, or clear any acreage outside of the specified time periods, reinitiation of consultation\\n\\n        with the Service will be triggered. That is all that is required.\\n\\n                                                        B.\\n\\n               We next consider whether the district court abused its discretion when it determined\\n\\n        that Appellants were not likely to succeed on their claim that the Section 404 permit\\n\\n        violated NEPA where the Corps issued an EA rather than an EIS. As we have explained,\\n\\n                                                      22\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942          Doc: 52     Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 23 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        an agency may prepare an EA to determine whether a proposed action will have a\\n\\n        significant impact on the human environment, such that it requires an EIS. 40 C.F.R.\\n\\n        §§ 1501.4, 1508.9.1.\\n\\n               “An agency’s decision to rely on an [EA] instead of preparing an [EIS] is entitled\\n\\n        to deference.” Mt. Lookout-Mt. Nebo Property Protection Ass’n v. FERC, 143 F.3d 165,\\n\\n        172 (4th Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). Thus, review on the merits “is limited to the\\n\\n        question of whether [the agency] reasonably concluded that the [proposed action] would\\n\\n        not significantly impact the quality of the human environment.” Id. “In determining\\n\\n        whether agency action was arbitrary or capricious, the court must consider whether the\\n\\n        agency considered the relevant factors and whether a clear error of judgment was made.”\\n\\n        Ohio Valley Env’t Coalition v. Aracoma Coal, 556 F.3d 177, 192 (4th Cir. 2009)\\n\\n        (citing Citizens To Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971)).\\n\\n        “Although this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful, the ultimate standard\\n\\n        of review is a narrow one. The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that\\n\\n        of the agency.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). “Deference is due where the agency\\n\\n        has examined the relevant data and provided an explanation of its decision that includes a\\n\\n        rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Id. (cleaned up)\\n\\n        (citations omitted).\\n\\n               Appellants argue that the Corps was arbitrary and capricious in its decision not to\\n\\n        prepare an EIS because comments Appellants filed in response to public notice of the\\n\\n        proposed permit approval pointed out that several of the “intensity factors” listed in 40\\n\\n        C.F.R. § 1508.27(b), see supra at 4, applied to the Cainhoy development such that the EA\\n\\n                                                    23\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 24 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        was not sufficient. In their comments, Appellants raised concerns about the significance\\n\\n        of the harm to endangered species; the effects and risks of placing the development in a\\n\\n        flood zone; the effect of filling 180 acres of wetlands; the risk that docks will proliferate\\n\\n        surrounding creeks after the development of waterfront homes; the impact on nearby\\n\\n        historic settlement communities; and the impact on the Francis Marion National Forest,\\n\\n        including making it more difficult for the Forest to execute necessary prescribed fires for\\n\\n        maintenance. And, in Appellants’ view, the EA did not adequately address or consider\\n\\n        these concerns and should have determined that they may be significant and, therefore,\\n\\n        required that an EIS be prepared.\\n\\n               The district court determined that the Appellants did not have a sufficient likelihood\\n\\n        of success on this claim because the EA “provides considerable discussion of the Project’s\\n\\n        impacts on the land and surrounding communities and responds to comments raised by\\n\\n        [Appellants] throughout the environmental comment and review period.” J.A. 1023. The\\n\\n        district court provided specific examples in its opinion as to how the EA considered the\\n\\n        risk to endangered species but determined that risk was mitigated below a significant level.\\n\\n        To be sure, the district court did not specifically consider the EA’s response to any of the\\n\\n        other issues raised by Appellants beyond noting that the EA substantively responded to\\n\\n        each of the concerns. Our own review nevertheless reveals that the EA expended fourteen\\n\\n        pages to specifically considering and responding to each of Appellants’ concerns.\\n\\n               Appellants argue on appeal, however, that the district court erred in its analysis\\n\\n        because it did not conduct a review of each of the significance factors itself to determine\\n\\n        whether the Cainhoy project required an EIS. Appellants are incorrect. Contrary to\\n\\n                                                     24\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 25 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Appellants’ assertions, the district court was not free to evaluate the significance of the\\n\\n        Cainhoy development of its own accord, other than for clear error, because a “court is not\\n\\n        empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.” Ohio Valley Env’t Coalition,\\n\\n        556 F.3d at 192 (quoting Citizens To Preserve Overton Park, Inc., 401 U.S. at 416)).\\n\\n        Instead, even on the merits, the district court would be limited to determining whether the\\n\\n        Corps took the required “hard look” at the environmental consequences. Ohio Valley Env’t\\n\\n        Coalition, 556 F.3d at 194. That is, it could only evaluate “whether the agency considered\\n\\n        the relevant factors and whether a clear error of judgment was made.” Id.\\n\\n               Given the procedural posture of this case, where the district court was required to\\n\\n        determine only whether Appellants had a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits of\\n\\n        their claim, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The district\\n\\n        court’s opinion makes clear that it reviewed the EA and determined that the Corps\\n\\n        considered each of the factors and issues raised by Appellants. At this stage, the district\\n\\n        court was satisfied that Appellants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their\\n\\n        claim that the Corps did not take the required hard look.

Relevant here, in 2018 Intervenors applied for a permit from the\\n\\n        Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act\\n\\n        because the project will impact wetlands -- in particular, the 181.5 acres of wetlands that\\n\\n        will be filled for development. In compliance with NEPA, the Corps completed an EA to\\n\\n        determine whether an EIS was required. And as part of its review, the Corps was required\\n\\n        to consult with the Service (together with the Corps, the “Federal Appellees”) to determine\\n\\n        whether the Cainhoy development project is “likely to jeopardize the continued existence”\\n\\n        of a threatened or endangered species. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">16 U.S.C. § 1536</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Specifically, the Corps evaluated\\n\\n        the Cainhoy development’s impact on the northern long-eared bat (“NLEB”), which was\\n\\n        then listed as threatened, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.\\n\\n               The Service issued an initial BiOp in 2018, which determined that the project was\\n\\n        not likely to jeopardize the NLEB or the red-cockaded woodpecker. Then, in 2022, after\\n\\n        four years of environmental review, the Corps completed its EA and concluded that issuing\\n\\n        the Section 404 permit would not have any significant environmental impacts after\\n\\n        accounting for mitigation measures, so no EIS was required.\\n\\n               In completing the EA, the Corps coordinated with other state and federal agencies,\\n\\n        participated in community meetings, and solicited and responded to public comments about\\n\\n        the Cainhoy development project. Of all the entities involved, only one requested that the\\n\\n        Corps complete an EIS. That request came from the lead plaintiff, Appellant South\\n\\n                                                        8\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52         Filed: 01/31/2025    Pg: 9 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Carolina Coastal Conservation League. The Corps denied this request based upon its\\n\\n        conclusion that the EA was legally sufficient. Therefore, the Corps issued the Section 404\\n\\n        Permit, allowing Intervenors to fill 181.5 acres of wetlands, on May 11, 2022. Work on\\n\\n        the Cainhoy development began at that time.\\n\\n              Appellants filed this lawsuit in the District of South Carolina on August 17, 2022,\\n\\n        alleging that the permit approval was unlawful because it violated NEPA and the ESA.\\n\\n        But in 2023, work on Cainhoy was paused, and the lawsuit stayed, while the Federal\\n\\n        Appellees reinitiated environmental review of the project because the NLEB had been\\n\\n        reclassified as an endangered species.\\n\\n              The NLEB has never been spotted in Cainhoy and was last documented about 8.5\\n\\n        miles away in the Francis Marion National Forest in 2019. As part of the reinitiated\\n\\n        consultation with the Service, Intervenors elected to presume the presence of NLEBs on\\n\\n        the Cainhoy property rather than conducting surveys to formally confirm or deny their\\n\\n        presence. Intervenors made this decision because they believed the cost and time of\\n\\n        surveys would render the project infeasible. The Service determined that presuming the\\n\\n        presence of the NLEB was acceptable given that the possible surveys would only have\\n\\n        confirmed or denied presence, rather than providing more useful data such as population\\n\\n        density. Thus, the Service determined that nothing about its review would change if there\\n\\n        had been a positive survey rather than a presumption of the NLEB’s presence.\\n\\n              In reviewing the Cainhoy development project to determine whether it would\\n\\n        jeopardize the existence of NLEBs, the Service determined that the project would remove\\n\\n        up to 3,906 acres of suitable roosting and foraging habitat. And it determined that the\\n\\n                                                    9\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942         Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 10 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        removal of habitat can result in the lethal and nonlethal take of NLEBs. While NLEBs in\\n\\n        South Carolina do not hibernate like bats in more northern states, they do take short winter\\n\\n        rests known as torpors. The Service thus determined that the highest risk of mortality to\\n\\n        NLEBs would be during the summer occupancy, from April 1 to July 15, and the winter\\n\\n        torpor period, from December 15 to February 15. Therefore, the Service restricted\\n\\n        Intervenors from conducting tree removal on 2,930 acres during those periods of time. As\\n\\n        to the remaining 976 acres of the Cainhoy development, the Service determined that those\\n\\n        acres would be cleared, if at all, when individual homeowners purchase plots in the future\\n\\n        and clear them for building. Because those acres would not be cleared all at once, but\\n\\n        rather in small increments over the 30 year permit term, the Service determined that they\\n\\n        could be cleared at any time of the year.\\n\\n               In addition, all tree clearing is subject to additional restrictions in order to minimize\\n\\n        impacts on NLEBs, including time of day restrictions to avoid feeding disruptions;\\n\\n        minimizing removal of snags (dead or dying trees) that are important to the species;\\n\\n        installing artificial roosts to supplement the loss of roosting habitat; complying with state\\n\\n        forestry best management practices; and yearly bat monitoring. With these restrictions, the\\n\\n        Service determined that “most incidental take [of NLEBs] will be non-lethal and\\n\\n        undetectable (e.g., bats fleeing disturbances caused by proposed activities, which creates\\n\\n        the likelihood of death or injury due to predation and reduced fitness).” J.A. 188.3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               3\\n                   Citations to the “J.A.” refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\\n\\n                                                         10\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942      Doc: 52         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 11 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               The Service also believed that any incidental take, lethal or not, would be difficult\\n\\n        to detect because (1) the bats are “small and occupy forested habitats”; (2) they form small,\\n\\n        widely dispersed colonies and may roost individually, sometimes under loose bark or in\\n\\n        tree cavities, making detection difficult; (3) finding dead or injured specimens was\\n\\n        unlikely; and, (4) bats are mostly nocturnal. J.A. 188.

Due to the\\n\\n        nature of the NLEBs and the small portion of available habitat the Cainhoy development\\n\\n        would remove -- 3,906 acres out of 12.86 million acres of forest in South Carolina -- the\\n\\n        Service “anticipate[d] that the displaced bats will relocate to the remaining forest land\\n\\n        within South Carolina,” J.A. 174, and determined that it did “not anticipate the neighboring\\n\\n        bat population to experience adverse effects.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 173</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\\n\\n               After the Service provided this information to the Corps in a revised BiOP, the\\n\\n        Corps modified the Section 404 permit to incorporate the BiOp’s restrictions on tree\\n\\n        clearing. And the Corps revised the EA’s discussion of the potential impacts of the\\n\\n        Cainhoy development to account for the potential impact on NLEBs. Ultimately, the Corps\\n\\n        concluded that the EA, rather than an EIS, was still sufficient because the permit\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                     11\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942        Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 12 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        modification was “minor” and “will not result in significant individual or cumulative\\n\\n        impacts on the human environment.” J.A. 271.\\n\\n               Intervenors resumed development of Cainhoy in July 2024.

Explaining its decision to not use the\\n\\n        number of individual NLEBs impacted as the anticipated take, the Service stated that it\\n\\n        “anticipates incidental take of the NLEB . . . will be difficult to detect.” J.A. 188. It\\n\\n        provided the following reasons for this conclusion:\\n\\n               1. The individuals are small and occupy forested habitats where they\\n                  are difficult to find;\\n\\n               2. Bats form small, widely dispersed maternity colonies, some\\n                  species occur under loose bark or in the cavities of trees, and males\\n                  and non-reproductive females may roost individually, which\\n                  makes finding the species or occupied habitats difficult;\\n\\n               3. Finding dead or injured specimens during or following Action\\n                  implementation is unlikely;\\n\\n               4. Bats are mostly nocturnal; and\\n\\n               5. Most incidental take will be non-lethal and undetectable (e.g., bats\\n                  fleeing disturbances caused by proposed activities, which creates\\n                  the likelihood of death or injury due to predation and reduced\\n                  fitness).\\n\\n        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\\n\\n               Thus, because the Service determined that it was “not practical to monitor take in\\n\\n        terms of individuals of the listed species,” it used acres “of forested habitats removed based\\n\\n        on seasonality during the implementation of the action as surrogate measures for the\\n\\n                                                     14\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942       Doc: 52           Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 15 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        anticipated amount or extent of take caused” by the Cainhoy development. J.A. 188.\\n\\n               As to the causal connection between the acreage of habitat cleared and the take of\\n\\n        NLEBs, the ITS referred back to section 4.6.2 of the BiOp. Section 4.6.2 explained that\\n\\n        “[t]ree removal [for Cainhoy] will affect approximately 3,906 ac[res] of NLEB roosting\\n\\n        and foraging habitat.” J.A. 172. It explained that the habitat removal could result in\\n\\n        “potential injury or mortality of NLEB individuals” if they are roosting in trees that are\\n\\n        removed or due to the loss of “foraging, commuting, and roosting habitat.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> But it also\\n\\n        explained that “[t]he amount of mortality would not be determinable since dead NLEBs\\n\\n        would likely go unnoticed, and estimating such mortality is difficult since NLEB density\\n\\n        data is not available.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 173</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\\n\\n               As to the potential for nonlethal harm to NLEBs, the Service explained that NLEBs\\n\\n        have the “ability to travel distances spanning further than the” Cainhoy development and\\n\\n        “will have flexibility of foraging habitat and breeding opportunity” outside of the acreage\\n\\n        to be cleared. J.A. 173. “This tree removal represents a small portion of foraging and\\n\\n        roosting habitat within the larger forest land available in South Carolina,” which the service\\n\\n        estimates to be approximately 12.86 million acres. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 174</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Thus, “due to their generalist\\n\\n        habits in roost selection and the abundance of forested lands, the potential adverse effects\\n\\n        are anticipated to be short-term as the bats will be able to relocate to other forest land within\\n\\n        South Carolina.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> The Service “anticipate[d] the displaced bats will relocate to the\\n\\n        remaining forest land within South Carolina,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.,</span><pre class=\"inline\"> and did “not anticipate the neighboring\\n\\n        bat population to experience adverse effects due to the [Cainhoy development].” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at\\n\\n        173</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\\n\\n                                                       15\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942         Doc: 52          Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 16 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                         2.\\n\\n                  Appellants argue that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that this\\n\\n        use of a habitat surrogate was unlawful because, in their view, it is not impractical for the\\n\\n        Service “to express the amount or extent of anticipated take” as a numeric value. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">50 C.F.R.\\n\\n        § 402.14</span><pre class=\"inline\">(i)(1)(i).

While Sierra Club did reject surrogate justifications similar to those here, the\\n\\n        BiOp and ITS are more specific in this case. They explain that the reason the take is\\n\\n        expected to be mostly nonlethal and undetectable is that NLEBs are expected to simply\\n\\n        “relocate to the remaining forest land within South Carolina,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 174</span><pre class=\"inline\">, and that any\\n\\n        nonlethal take experienced when a NLEB flees a tree and experiences “reduced fitness”\\n\\n        from having a travel farther to a new roost, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 188</span><pre class=\"inline\">, is undetectable. That point is well\\n\\n        taken, particularly considering the fact that the 263,904-acre Francis Marion National\\n\\n        Forest is adjacent to Cainhoy, all of which is in a protected status.\\n\\n               Appellants protest that even if the use of a surrogate is proper here, the Service’s\\n\\n        proffered surrogate fails because it did not sufficiently “[d]escribe[] the causal link between\\n\\n        the surrogate and take of the listed species,” or “set[] a clear standard for determining when\\n\\n        the level of anticipated take has been exceeded.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">50 C.F.R. § 402.14</span><pre class=\"inline\">(i)(1)(i). The district\\n\\n        court rejected these arguments and determined that the casual link described in the ITS was\\n\\n        sufficient because it explained that “tree removal will affect 3,906 ac[res] of NLEB\\n\\n        roosting and foraging habitat,” and that the takes expected would be caused by the tree\\n\\n        clearing activity.

As to whether the surrogate set a clear standard,\\n\\n        the district court determined that the habitat surrogate was enforceable because “reinitiation\\n\\n                                                      21\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1942       Doc: 52         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 22 of 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        of consultation will be triggered if the project exceeds the anticipated 3,906 acres, if any\\n\\n        acreage is cleared within sensitive seasons, or if developers do not comply with the special\\n\\n        conditions of the [404] permit.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 1030</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\\n\\n               Here, too, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The causal\\n\\n        link between the use of the acres of destroyed habitat and any incidental take of NLEBs is\\n\\n        clear. On its face, the ITS explains that “[i]n this case, the Service is using ac[res] of\\n\\n        forested habitats removed based on seasonality during the implementation of the action as\\n\\n        surrogate measures for the anticipated amount or extent of take caused by the proposed\\n\\n        Action.” J.A. 188. And the ITS points to Section 4.6 of the BiOp for further explanation.\\n\\n        That section explains that the consequences of habitat removal “include potential injury or\\n\\n        mortality of NLEB individuals roosting in trees that are removed, and loss of foraging,\\n\\n        commuting, and roosting habitat.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 172</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

In their comments, Appellants raised concerns about the significance\\n\\n        of the harm to endangered species; the effects and risks of placing the development in a\\n\\n        flood zone; the effect of filling 180 acres of wetlands; the risk that docks will proliferate\\n\\n        surrounding creeks after the development of waterfront homes; the impact on nearby\\n\\n        historic settlement communities; and the impact on the Francis Marion National Forest,\\n\\n        including making it more difficult for the Forest to execute necessary prescribed fires for\\n\\n        maintenance. And, in Appellants’ view, the EA did not adequately address or consider\\n\\n        these concerns and should have determined that they may be significant and, therefore,\\n\\n        required that an EIS be prepared.\\n\\n               The district court determined that the Appellants did not have a sufficient likelihood\\n\\n        of success on this claim because the EA “provides considerable discussion of the Project’s\\n\\n        impacts on the land and surrounding communities and responds to comments raised by\\n\\n        [Appellants] throughout the environmental comment and review period.” J.A. 1023.

Appellants are incorrect.

Hoffman, Assistant United\\n        States Attorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Columbia, South\\n        Carolina, for Appellee.\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 2 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        PAMELA HARRIS, Circuit Judge:\\n\\n               Jarvis Mikel Jackson pled guilty to possession of a firearm as a felon, in violation\\n\\n        of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The district court calculated an advisory Sentencing Guidelines\\n\\n        range of 110 to 120 months’ imprisonment and sentenced Jackson to a prison term of 115\\n\\n        months. In this appeal, Jackson raises two challenges to his sentence.\\n\\n               First, Jackson argues that the district court erred in calculating his Guidelines\\n\\n        sentencing range by treating two prior South Carolina convictions for drug distribution as\\n\\n        “controlled substance offense[s]” under the Guidelines, increasing his base offense level.\\n\\n        See U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(1). According to Jackson, that determination was inconsistent\\n\\n        with United States v. Campbell, 22 F.4th 438 (4th Cir. 2022), which held that a violation\\n\\n        of West Virginia’s controlled substances statute did not qualify as a Guidelines controlled\\n\\n        substance offense. We disagree. As we have explained already, South Carolina’s drug\\n\\n        distribution statute is “materially distinguishable” from the West Virginia statute at issue\\n\\n        in Campbell, and a distribution conviction under South Carolina’s statute is a controlled\\n\\n        substance offense as defined by the Guidelines. See United States v. Davis, 75 F.4th 428,\\n\\n        443–45 (4th Cir. 2023). That precedent squarely governs here.\\n\\n               We do, however, agree with Jackson that the district court failed to explain its 115-\\n\\n        month sentence or address Jackson’s arguments for a lower term of imprisonment. The\\n\\n        absence of an individualized explanation for a sentence constitutes procedural error, and\\n\\n        we therefore vacate Jackson’s sentence and remand for resentencing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                     2\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 3 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                     I.\\n\\n               This is the second time Jackson has appealed his sentence, and the procedural\\n\\n        history of this case is somewhat complex. We begin with Jackson’s first sentencing and\\n\\n        appeal. We then briefly describe our decisions in United States v. Groves, 65 F.4th 166\\n\\n        (4th Cir. 2023) and United States v. Davis, 75 F.4th 428 (4th Cir. 2023), which issued\\n\\n        shortly after we decided Jackson’s original appeal and before his resentencing. Finally, we\\n\\n        turn to the resentencing now at issue.\\n\\n                                                     A.\\n\\n                                                     1.\\n\\n               In 2021, Jackson pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a felon in\\n\\n        violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The probation office prepared a presentence report\\n\\n        (“PSR”) assigning Jackson an enhanced base offense level of 26. That base offense level\\n\\n        rested in part on Jackson’s two prior felony convictions for distribution of crack cocaine\\n\\n        under South Carolina Code § 44-53-375(B), which the PSR classified as “controlled\\n\\n        substance offense[s].” See U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(1) (increasing base offense level when,\\n\\n        inter alia, a defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for a “controlled substance\\n\\n        offense”). All told, the PSR calculated an advisory Guidelines range of 110 to 120 months’\\n\\n        imprisonment. 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               1\\n                 Jackson’s total offense level and criminal history category ordinarily would lead\\n        to a Guidelines range of 110 to 137 months. That range was capped here by the 120-month\\n        statutory maximum sentence for Jackson’s § 922(g)(1) conviction.\\n                                                     3\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 4 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               Jackson objected to the PSR’s treatment of his South Carolina convictions as\\n\\n        predicate controlled substance offenses, relying on our then-recent decision in United\\n\\n        States v. Campbell, 22 F.4th 438 (4th Cir. 2022). In Campbell, we held that a drug\\n\\n        distribution conviction under West Virginia’s controlled substances statute did not qualify,\\n\\n        under the categorical approach, as a Guidelines controlled substance offense. Id. at 441–\\n\\n        42, 449. The Guidelines definition of a “controlled substance offense,” we explained,\\n\\n        excluded inchoate attempt offenses from its ambit. Id. at 444–46; see U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(b)\\n\\n        (2021) (defining “controlled substance offense”). 2     But West Virginia’s statute was\\n\\n        broader, reaching attempted as well as completed deliveries of controlled substances, and\\n\\n        so it was not a categorical match for the Guidelines definition. Id. at 441–42.\\n\\n               Jackson argued that the same reasoning should apply to his case. Like the West\\n\\n        Virginia statute at issue in Campbell, Jackson contended, South Carolina Code § 44-53-\\n\\n        375(B) criminalizes attempted drug deliveries, taking it outside the scope of a Guidelines\\n\\n        controlled substance offense. And without two predicate controlled substance offenses,\\n\\n        Jackson explained, a base offense level of 26 was not warranted. Instead, Jackson’s base\\n\\n        offense level would fall to 20, leading to a Guidelines sentencing range of 63 to 78 months’\\n\\n        imprisonment.\\n\\n\\n               2\\n                  The Sentencing Commission has since amended § 4B1.2(b)’s definition of\\n        “controlled substance offense” to include inchoate offenses. See Amendments to the\\n        Sentencing Guidelines § 4B1.2(d) (Apr. 27, 2023), https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/\\n        files/pdf/amendment-process/reader-friendly-amendments/202305_RF.pdf\\n        [https://perma.cc/Y3AS-25DW]. So today, a prior conviction under West Virginia’s\\n        controlled substances statute may qualify as a “controlled substance offense” for\\n        Guidelines purposes.\\n                                                     4\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 5 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               The district court overruled Jackson’s objection.      The court agreed with the\\n\\n        government that Jackson’s reading of South Carolina’s statute was incorrect, and that in\\n\\n        fact, a § 44-53-375(B) distribution offense does not include attempted distribution. That\\n\\n        meant that Campbell was distinguishable, and that Jackson’s South Carolina convictions\\n\\n        remained controlled substance offenses under the Guidelines. The district court thus\\n\\n        adopted the PSR’s base offense level of 26 and Guidelines range of 110 to 120 months’\\n\\n        imprisonment.\\n\\n               The district court then sentenced Jackson to a prison term of 115 months, followed\\n\\n        by three years of supervised release. The court’s discussion of its sentence was brief. The\\n\\n        court did not “discuss the factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) or otherwise explain the basis for\\n\\n        Jackson’s sentence in any detail.” United States v. Jackson, No. 22-4179, 2023 WL\\n\\n        2852624, at *2 (4th Cir. Apr. 10, 2023) (“Jackson I”). Instead, the court simply stated that\\n\\n        it believed it had correctly calculated the Guidelines and found Jackson’s case to be “a\\n\\n        typical case contemplated by the [G]uidelines.” S.A. 19. 3\\n\\n                                                     2.\\n\\n               Jackson appealed his sentence, continuing to argue that his prior South Carolina\\n\\n        drug distribution convictions are not controlled substance offenses under the Guidelines.\\n\\n        South Carolina’s statute, Jackson explained, defines “distribute” as “deliver,” S.C. Code\\n\\n        Ann. § 44-53-110(17), and “deliver or delivery” to include the “attempted transfer” of a\\n\\n        controlled substance, id. at § 44-53-110(10) (defining “‘deliver’ or ‘delivery’” as an\\n\\n\\n               3\\n                 “S.A.” refers to the supplemental appendix filed by the government. “J.A.” refers\\n        to the joint appendix filed by both parties.\\n                                                     5\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580        Doc: 42       Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 6 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        “actual, constructive, or attempted transfer”). It follows, he argued, that South Carolina’s\\n\\n        statute, like the West Virginia statute reviewed in Campbell, reaches attempted delivery of\\n\\n        a controlled substance, broadening it beyond the Guidelines definition of controlled\\n\\n        substance offense.\\n\\n               In an unpublished opinion, we agreed with Jackson. Jackson I, 2023 WL 2852624,\\n\\n        at *3. Under Campbell, we reasoned, a state controlled substances law that sweeps in\\n\\n        inchoate attempt offenses goes beyond the conduct covered by the Guidelines definition in\\n\\n        § 4B1.2(b) and is therefore not a controlled substance offense under Guideline\\n\\n        § 2K2.1(a)(1). Id. at *3. And South Carolina’s “distribution” offense, we concluded, like\\n\\n        West Virginia’s, reaches attempted deliveries outside the scope of § 4B1.2(b). Id. We\\n\\n        were not persuaded by the government’s argument that under South Carolina’s law an\\n\\n        “attempted transfer” is not equivalent to an attempted delivery, but instead refers to a\\n\\n        completed delivery, nor by the government’s other efforts to distinguish Campbell. Id. at\\n\\n        *3–5. Accordingly, we vacated Jackson’s sentence and remanded for resentencing. Id. at\\n\\n        *6.\\n\\n                                                    B.\\n\\n               Almost immediately after our unpublished decision in Jackson – but before\\n\\n        Jackson’s resentencing – we issued two published decisions of importance here.\\n\\n               First, in United States v. Groves, 65 F.4th 166, 174 (4th Cir. 2023), we held that\\n\\n        Campbell notwithstanding, a drug distribution conviction under the federal controlled\\n\\n        substances statute, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), is a controlled substance offense under the\\n\\n        Guidelines. We recognized that the federal statute defines “distribute” as “deliver,” and\\n\\n                                                     6\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 7 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        “deliver” to include an “attempted transfer.”       65 F.4th at 172 (quoting 21 U.S.C.\\n\\n        §§ 802(11), 802(8)). But we agreed with the government – and several other circuit courts\\n\\n        – that “attempted transfer” as used in the federal statute means a “completed delivery rather\\n\\n        than an attempt crime,” in part because the federal law separately criminalizes attempt\\n\\n        offenses. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). That rendered the federal law “materially\\n\\n        different” from Campbell’s West Virginia law, id. at 173, and made it a categorical match\\n\\n        for a Guidelines controlled substance offense, id. at 174. In a footnote, we rejected the\\n\\n        defendant’s reliance on Jackson I, an unpublished decision without precedential effect. Id.\\n\\n        at 173 n.4.\\n\\n               Next came United States v. Davis, 75 F.4th 428, 443 (4th Cir. 2023), in which we\\n\\n        considered the very same South Carolina statute now at issue, § 44-53-375(B), and held\\n\\n        that a distribution violation constitutes a controlled substance offense as defined by the\\n\\n        Guidelines. We rejected the defendant’s argument that “we [we]re bound by Campbell to\\n\\n        conclude that a South Carolina Code [§] 44-53-375(B) ‘distribution’ offense criminalizes\\n\\n        the attempt offense of attempted distribution” and is thus broader than the Guidelines\\n\\n        definition. Id. at 444. Instead, we followed Groves: Like the federal statue in Groves, we\\n\\n        reasoned, South Carolina law separately codifies the offense of attempted distribution; and\\n\\n        under South Carolina law, like federal law, an “attempted transfer” of drugs is a “completed\\n\\n        distribution,” not an attempted one. Id. at 443. Because South Carolina’s § 44-53-375(B)\\n\\n        distribution offense does not in fact reach attempt offenses, it is “materially\\n\\n        distinguishable” from West Virginia’s law as understood in Campbell, and a distribution\\n\\n        conviction under § 44-53-375(B) categorically qualifies as a Guidelines controlled\\n\\n                                                     7\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 8 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        substance offense. Id. at 445. Again, we declined to follow Jackson I – decided, we noted,\\n\\n        without the benefit of the Groves precedent – as an unpublished and nonprecedential\\n\\n        decision. Id. at 444 n.15.\\n\\n                                                     C.\\n\\n               That brings us, finally, to Jackson’s resentencing, from which the current appeal\\n\\n        arises. About a month after our decision in Davis, the probation office issued a revised\\n\\n        PSR. The PSR continued to treat Jackson’s prior South Carolina convictions as controlled\\n\\n        substance offenses, and again calculated a Guidelines range of 110 to 120 months’\\n\\n        imprisonment. The probation office rejected Jackson’s argument that it was bound by the\\n\\n        mandate rule to give effect to Jackson I, reasoning that our intervening decision in Davis\\n\\n        constituted a dramatic change in the law.\\n\\n               Before the district court, Jackson again objected, arguing that Jackson I prohibited\\n\\n        the court from counting his South Carolina convictions as Guidelines “controlled substance\\n\\n        offense[s].” He recognized that an exception to the mandate rule applies when “controlling\\n\\n        legal authority has changed dramatically,” see United States v. Bell, 5 F.3d 64, 67 (4th Cir.\\n\\n        1993), and that Davis marked a change from the earlier decision in Jackson I. Nevertheless,\\n\\n        Jackson contended, there was no cognizable change because Davis is not “controlling legal\\n\\n        authority”: Davis is in irreconcilable conflict with Campbell; Campbell, as the earlier panel\\n\\n        opinion, controls; and Davis is therefore without effect for purposes of the mandate rule,\\n\\n        leaving the district court bound by Jackson I.\\n\\n               Without an enhanced base offense level predicated on his South Carolina\\n\\n        convictions, Jackson again explained, his Guidelines sentencing range would fall to 63 to\\n\\n                                                     8\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 9 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        78 months’ imprisonment. Jackson urged the district court to impose a sentence within\\n\\n        that range, either as a within-Guidelines sentence following Jackson I or, if the district\\n\\n        court decided to follow Davis, as a downward variant sentence. In arguing that the 18\\n\\n        U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors supported such a sentence, Jackson relied primarily on his post-\\n\\n        sentencing conduct while in custody: Jackson had been on excellent behavior, with no\\n\\n        disciplinary infractions, and had been taking job skills classes and working toward a GED.\\n\\n        Jackson also argued that his criminal history score fully accounted for his prior offenses\\n\\n        and that he would return to a loving family home – a fiancée and four children – upon\\n\\n        release.\\n\\n               The district court overruled Jackson’s objection and decided to “follow the Davis\\n\\n        decision,” calling this an “easy” question. J.A. 22. Davis, the court noted – unlike\\n\\n        Campbell – “actually dealt with the South Carolina statute” at issue, J.A. 22–23, making\\n\\n        clear that a violation of § 44-53-375(B) qualifies as a controlled substance offense under\\n\\n        the Guidelines definition. The court agreed with the government that the exception to the\\n\\n        mandate rule for changes in the law applied, and that it should adhere to Davis rather than\\n\\n        to Jackson I. Accordingly, it adopted the PSR advisory sentencing range of 110 to 120\\n\\n        months’ imprisonment.\\n\\n               The court again sentenced Jackson to a 115-month prison term. And again, its\\n\\n        discussion was brief. The court “incorporate[d] my comments and all of the record that\\n\\n        was before me incorporated into this adjudication of his sentence,” spelled out Jackson’s\\n\\n        offense level and criminal history category, and said it had “considered those factors under\\n\\n        18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).” J.A. 23. No further explanation was provided.\\n\\n                                                     9\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580       Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025       Pg: 10 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               Jackson timely appealed.\\n\\n\\n                                                      II.\\n\\n               On appeal, Jackson challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. “In\\n\\n        determining procedural reasonableness, this Court considers whether the district court\\n\\n        properly calculated the defendant’s advisory guidelines range, gave the parties an\\n\\n        opportunity to argue for an appropriate sentence, considered the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\\n\\n        factors, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence.” United States v. Ross, 912 F.3d\\n\\n        740, 744 (4th Cir. 2019). According to Jackson, the district court erred in two of these\\n\\n        respects: by improperly calculating his Guidelines range and by failing to adequately\\n\\n        explain its sentence. For the reasons given below, we disagree with Jackson’s first claim\\n\\n        but agree with his second, and we therefore vacate Jackson’s sentence and remand for\\n\\n        resentencing.\\n\\n                                                      A.\\n\\n               Jackson argues first that the district court incorrectly used his prior drug distribution\\n\\n        convictions under South Carolina’s § 44-53-375(B) to increase his Guidelines base offense\\n\\n        level, treating them as controlled substance offenses contrary to our controlling decision in\\n\\n        Campbell. We review de novo whether a prior conviction qualifies as a controlled\\n\\n        substance offense under the Sentencing Guidelines, see Davis, 75 F.4th at 441, and we\\n\\n        agree with the district court that Jackson’s South Carolina convictions so qualify.\\n\\n               Because this is Jackson’s second appeal of his sentence, we begin with the mandate\\n\\n        rule. The parties do not dispute the rule’s contours as they apply here. They agree that\\n\\n\\n                                                      10\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580        Doc: 42       Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 11 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        under ordinary circumstances, the district court would have been required to carry out the\\n\\n        mandate of Jackson I on remand, treating Jackson’s South Carolina convictions as outside\\n\\n        the Guidelines definition of a controlled substance offense and lowering Jackson’s base\\n\\n        offense level accordingly. See Bell, 5 F.3d at 66 (explaining that the mandate rule generally\\n\\n        “forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court”).\\n\\n        They also agree that an exception to the mandate rule exists when “controlling legal\\n\\n        authority has changed dramatically,” see id. at 67, allowing a district court to consider the\\n\\n        merits anew and follow later precedent. And they agree that there has been a “change” in\\n\\n        the law here – that after our unpublished decision in Jackson I, we changed course in Davis,\\n\\n        expressly declining to follow Jackson I and instead holding in a published opinion that a\\n\\n        conviction under South Carolina’s § 44-53-375(B) qualifies as a Guidelines controlled\\n\\n        substance offense.\\n\\n               But while there may have been a “change,” Jackson argues, there was not a change\\n\\n        in “controlling legal authority,” because Davis is not “controlling.” Instead, Jackson\\n\\n        argues, because there is an irreconcilable conflict between Davis and the earlier-decided\\n\\n        Campbell, Campbell continues to control. See McMellon v. United States, 387 F.3d 329,\\n\\n        333 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (“When published panel opinions are in direct conflict on a\\n\\n        given issue, the earliest opinion controls[.]”). The parties’ dispute, in other words, is not\\n\\n        about the mandate rule but about the status of Davis: According to Jackson, Davis is\\n\\n        without “legal authority” – taking it outside the mandate rule exception – because it cannot\\n\\n        be reconciled with our earlier decision in Campbell.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                     11\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42          Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 12 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               As the district court observed, this may be an “interesting dynamic,” but it is also\\n\\n        an “easy” question, J.A. 22, because Jackson’s argument is foreclosed by Davis itself. We\\n\\n        considered precisely this issue in Davis, in which the defendant argued – just as Jackson\\n\\n        does here – that the West Virginia statute in Campbell and South Carolina’s drug\\n\\n        distribution statute are “materially indistinguishable,” and that we were therefore “bound\\n\\n        by Campbell” to conclude that a distribution conviction under South Carolina’s § 44-53-\\n\\n        375(B) does not qualify as a Guidelines controlled substance offense. Davis, 75 F.4th at\\n\\n        444. But we held to the contrary, finding that Campbell is not controlling when it comes\\n\\n        to the South Carolina statute. Id. at 444–45. We of course recognized Campbell’s core\\n\\n        holding that “an attempt offense cannot be a ‘controlled substance offense,’ as defined in\\n\\n        Guidelines [§] 4B1.2(b).” Id. at 441–42. 4 That holding did not apply to § 44-53-375(B),\\n\\n        however: The “South Carolina statutory scheme” is “materially distinguishable” from\\n\\n        West Viriginia’s in that it does not reach attempted distribution offenses, making Campbell\\n\\n        likewise distinguishable. Id. at 445.\\n\\n               That holding squarely governs here.         Davis has already decided that South\\n\\n        Carolina’s drug distribution statute is materially different from the West Virginia statute at\\n\\n        issue in Campbell. The purported “conflict” between Campbell and Davis on which\\n\\n        defendant’s entire argument rests does not exist, for the reasons given by Davis. Jackson\\n\\n        may disagree with Davis’s analysis, but Davis is published, binding authority. And when\\n\\n\\n\\n               4\\n                To avoid any confusion, we note again that the Sentencing Commission has since\\n        amended the Guidelines definition of controlled substance offense so that it now includes\\n        inchoate attempt offenses. See supra n.2.\\n                                                     12\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 13 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Davis declined to follow our unpublished decision in Jackson I, see id. at 444 n.15, and\\n\\n        instead ruled that a South Carolina distribution conviction under § 44-53-375(B) is a\\n\\n        Guidelines controlled substance offense, it changed the “controlling legal authority” for\\n\\n        purposes of the mandate rule exception, see Bell, 5 F.3d at 67, allowing the district court\\n\\n        to follow our new precedent on remand.\\n\\n               The district court correctly relied on Davis and properly treated Jackson’s South\\n\\n        Carolina drug distribution convictions as predicate controlled substance offenses under the\\n\\n        Guidelines. Accordingly, we find no procedural error in the district court’s calculation of\\n\\n        Jackson’s Guidelines sentencing range.\\n\\n                                                    B.\\n\\n               We turn next to Jackson’s argument that the district court failed to sufficiently\\n\\n        explain his 115-month sentence. At resentencing, Jackson argued that even if the district\\n\\n        court overruled his Campbell-based objection and adopted the Guidelines range of 110 to\\n\\n        120 months, it should vary down to a term of somewhere between 63 and 78 months under\\n\\n        the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors. Although the district court ably addressed Jackson’s legal\\n\\n        objection regarding the status of his South Carolina convictions, it did not address\\n\\n        Jackson’s argument for a downward variant sentence, and it did not explain the 115-month\\n\\n        sentence it selected.   We agree with Jackson that this constituted procedural error\\n\\n        warranting a vacatur of his sentence and a remand for resentencing.\\n\\n               We review a district court’s sentence – whether inside or outside the Guidelines\\n\\n        range – under a “deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.” Gall v. United States, 552 U.S.\\n\\n        38, 41 (2007). “A district court is required to provide an individualized assessment based\\n\\n                                                    13\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 14 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        on the facts before the court, and to explain adequately the sentence imposed to allow for\\n\\n        meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.” United\\n\\n        States v. Lewis, 958 F.3d 240, 243 (4th Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). That\\n\\n        explanation must “provide some indication that the court considered the § 3553(a) factors\\n\\n        and applied them to the particular defendant.” United States v. Nance, 957 F.3d 204, 212–\\n\\n        13 (4th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up). And of special relevance here, when a defendant – like\\n\\n        Jackson – is being resentenced on remand after appeal, new “evidence of [the] defendant’s\\n\\n        rehabilitation since his prior sentencing” may “support a downward variance from the\\n\\n        advisory Guidelines range.” Pepper v. United States, 562 U.S. 476, 490 (2011).\\n\\n               As described above, the district court’s discussion of its 115-month, within-\\n\\n        Guidelines sentence was abbreviated, covering just a few lines of text in the transcript.\\n\\n        Several were devoted to the court’s introductory “incorporat[ion]” of “[its] comments and\\n\\n        all of the record that was before [it].” J.A. 23. The court then walked through Jackson’s\\n\\n        Guidelines offense level, criminal history category, and advisory sentencing range; noted\\n\\n        Jackson’s inability to pay a fine; and concluded by saying, “[t]he [c]ourt has considered\\n\\n        those factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),” without saying what “those factors” were. Id.\\n\\n               We cannot find that explanation sufficient. Without belaboring the point, we note\\n\\n        the following: The district court did not address any individualized fact about Jackson in\\n\\n        imposing sentence. See United States v. Lynn, 592 F.3d 572, 584 (4th Cir. 2010) (“[A]\\n\\n        district court’s explanation of its sentence need not be lengthy, but the court must offer\\n\\n        some individualized assessment justifying the sentence imposed.” (internal quotation\\n\\n        marks omitted) (emphasis in original)).      It did not identify any § 3553(a) factor it\\n\\n                                                    14\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580       Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 15 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        considered, or explain how any § 3553(a) factor “applied” to “the particular defendant” in\\n\\n        front of it. Nance, 957 F.3d at 212–13. It did not mention, engage with, or rule on\\n\\n        Jackson’s request for a downward variance. See United States v. Blue, 877 F.3d 513, 519\\n\\n        (4th Cir. 2017) (“[A] [district] court must address the parties’ nonfrivolous arguments in\\n\\n        favor of a particular sentence[.]”). And it never discussed the heart of Jackson’s argument\\n\\n        for a downward variance: that his post-sentencing conduct – exemplary disciplinary\\n\\n        record, GED classes, and the like – were evidence of rehabilitation. See id.; Nance, 957\\n\\n        F.3d at 212–13 (district court must indicate that it has considered arguments for a lower\\n\\n        sentence).\\n\\n               We are not persuaded by the government’s contrary arguments. It is true, as the\\n\\n        government explains, that the district court accepted the parties’ sentencing memoranda\\n\\n        and heard both parties’ arguments. But that minimum requirement of procedural fairness\\n\\n        – that a district court provide a defendant with the opportunity to present argument – is\\n\\n        distinct from the requirement that a district court explain its sentence in light of those\\n\\n        arguments. See Blue, 877 F.3d at 520.\\n\\n               The government also suggests that the explanation here can be bolstered by the\\n\\n        court’s “specific[] incorporat[ion]” of its comments at Jackson’s first sentencing. We are\\n\\n        less certain than the government that the court intended to “incorporate” materials from the\\n\\n        original sentencing, rather than the materials currently before it. See J.A. 23 (“I incorporate\\n\\n        my comments and all of the record that was before me incorporated into this adjudication\\n\\n        of his sentence.”). But regardless, a reference back to Jackson’s first sentencing adds little.\\n\\n        As we noted in Jackson I, the court’s explanation at that sentencing, too, was “brief,” with\\n\\n                                                      15\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42        Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 16 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        the court failing to “discuss the factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) or otherwise explain the\\n\\n        basis for Jackson’s sentence in any detail.” Jackson I, 2023 WL 2852624, at *2. And of\\n\\n        course, the court at that first sentencing could not have considered or addressed the\\n\\n        evidence on which Jackson chiefly relied at his resentencing, concerning his post-\\n\\n        sentencing conduct and rehabilitation.\\n\\n              We express no view as to the merits of Jackson’s arguments for a lower sentence.\\n\\n        We hold only that the district court committed procedural error when it failed to address\\n\\n        those arguments and to provide an individualized explanation for the sentence it selected.\\n\\n        Accordingly, we vacate Jackson’s sentence and remand for resentencing.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                   III.\\n\\n              For the foregoing reasons, we vacate Jackson’s sentence and remand for\\n\\n        resentencing proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                   VACATED AND REMANDED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                   16\\n\\x0c', 'html': '', 'html_lawbox': '', 'html_columbia': '', 'html_anon_2020': '', 'xml_harvard': '', 'html_with_citations': '<pre class=\"inline\">USCA4 Appeal: 23-4580     Doc: 42        Filed: 01/31/2025   Pg: 1 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            PUBLISHED\\n\\n                             UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\\n                                 FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\n\\n\\n                                             No. 23-4580\\n\\n\\n        UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\\n\\n                           Plaintiff – Appellee,\\n\\n                     v.\\n\\n        JARVIS MIKEL JACKSON,\\n\\n                           Defendant – Appellant.\\n\\n\\n        Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, at\\n        Anderson.

The district court calculated an advisory Sentencing Guidelines\\n\\n        range of 110 to 120 months’ imprisonment and sentenced Jackson to a prison term of 115\\n\\n        months. In this appeal, Jackson raises two challenges to his sentence.\\n\\n               First, Jackson argues that the district court erred in calculating his Guidelines\\n\\n        sentencing range by treating two prior South Carolina convictions for drug distribution as\\n\\n        “controlled substance offense[s]” under the Guidelines, increasing his base offense level.\\n\\n        See U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(1). According to Jackson, that determination was inconsistent\\n\\n        with United States v. Campbell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">22 F.4th 438</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2022), which held that a violation\\n\\n        of West Virginia’s controlled substances statute did not qualify as a Guidelines controlled\\n\\n        substance offense. We disagree. As we have explained already, South Carolina’s drug\\n\\n        distribution statute is “materially distinguishable” from the West Virginia statute at issue\\n\\n        in Campbell, and a distribution conviction under South Carolina’s statute is a controlled\\n\\n        substance offense as defined by the Guidelines. See United States v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">75 F.4th 428</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\\n\\n        443–45 (4th Cir. 2023). That precedent squarely governs here.\\n\\n               We do, however, agree with Jackson that the district court failed to explain its 115-\\n\\n        month sentence or address Jackson’s arguments for a lower term of imprisonment. The\\n\\n        absence of an individualized explanation for a sentence constitutes procedural error, and\\n\\n        we therefore vacate Jackson’s sentence and remand for resentencing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                     2\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 3 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                     I.\\n\\n               This is the second time Jackson has appealed his sentence, and the procedural\\n\\n        history of this case is somewhat complex. We begin with Jackson’s first sentencing and\\n\\n        appeal. We then briefly describe our decisions in United States v. Groves, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">65 F.4th 166</span><pre class=\"inline\">\\n\\n        (4th Cir. 2023) and United States v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">75 F.4th 428</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2023), which issued\\n\\n        shortly after we decided Jackson’s original appeal and before his resentencing. Finally, we\\n\\n        turn to the resentencing now at issue.\\n\\n                                                     A.\\n\\n                                                     1.\\n\\n               In 2021, Jackson pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a felon in\\n\\n        violation of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. § 922</span><pre class=\"inline\">(g)(1). The probation office prepared a presentence report\\n\\n        (“PSR”) assigning Jackson an enhanced base offense level of 26. That base offense level\\n\\n        rested in part on Jackson’s two prior felony convictions for distribution of crack cocaine\\n\\n        under South Carolina Code § 44-53-375(B), which the PSR classified as “controlled\\n\\n        substance offense[s].” See U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(1) (increasing base offense level when,\\n\\n        inter alia, a defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for a “controlled substance\\n\\n        offense”). All told, the PSR calculated an advisory Guidelines range of 110 to 120 months’\\n\\n        imprisonment. 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               1\\n                 Jackson’s total offense level and criminal history category ordinarily would lead\\n        to a Guidelines range of 110 to 137 months. That range was capped here by the 120-month\\n        statutory maximum sentence for Jackson’s § 922(g)(1) conviction.\\n                                                     3\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 4 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               Jackson objected to the PSR’s treatment of his South Carolina convictions as\\n\\n        predicate controlled substance offenses, relying on our then-recent decision in United\\n\\n        States v. Campbell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">22 F.4th 438</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2022). In Campbell, we held that a drug\\n\\n        distribution conviction under West Virginia’s controlled substances statute did not qualify,\\n\\n        under the categorical approach, as a Guidelines controlled substance offense. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 441–\\n\\n        42, 449. The Guidelines definition of a “controlled substance offense,” we explained,\\n\\n        excluded inchoate attempt offenses from its ambit. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 444–46; see U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(b)\\n\\n        (2021) (defining “controlled substance offense”). 2     But West Virginia’s statute was\\n\\n        broader, reaching attempted as well as completed deliveries of controlled substances, and\\n\\n        so it was not a categorical match for the Guidelines definition. Id. at 441–42.\\n\\n               Jackson argued that the same reasoning should apply to his case. Like the West\\n\\n        Virginia statute at issue in Campbell, Jackson contended, South Carolina Code § 44-53-\\n\\n        375(B) criminalizes attempted drug deliveries, taking it outside the scope of a Guidelines\\n\\n        controlled substance offense. And without two predicate controlled substance offenses,\\n\\n        Jackson explained, a base offense level of 26 was not warranted. Instead, Jackson’s base\\n\\n        offense level would fall to 20, leading to a Guidelines sentencing range of 63 to 78 months’\\n\\n        imprisonment.\\n\\n\\n               2\\n                  The Sentencing Commission has since amended § 4B1.2(b)’s definition of\\n        “controlled substance offense” to include inchoate offenses. See Amendments to the\\n        Sentencing Guidelines § 4B1.2(d) (Apr. 27, 2023), https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/\\n        files/pdf/amendment-process/reader-friendly-amendments/202305_RF.pdf\\n        [https://perma.cc/Y3AS-25DW]. So today, a prior conviction under West Virginia’s\\n        controlled substances statute may qualify as a “controlled substance offense” for\\n        Guidelines purposes.\\n                                                     4\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 5 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               The district court overruled Jackson’s objection.      The court agreed with the\\n\\n        government that Jackson’s reading of South Carolina’s statute was incorrect, and that in\\n\\n        fact, a § 44-53-375(B) distribution offense does not include attempted distribution. That\\n\\n        meant that Campbell was distinguishable, and that Jackson’s South Carolina convictions\\n\\n        remained controlled substance offenses under the Guidelines. The district court thus\\n\\n        adopted the PSR’s base offense level of 26 and Guidelines range of 110 to 120 months’\\n\\n        imprisonment.\\n\\n               The district court then sentenced Jackson to a prison term of 115 months, followed\\n\\n        by three years of supervised release. The court’s discussion of its sentence was brief. The\\n\\n        court did not “discuss the factors in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. § 3553</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a) or otherwise explain the basis for\\n\\n        Jackson’s sentence in any detail.” United States v. Jackson, No. 22-4179, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 WL\\n\\n        2852624</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (4th Cir. Apr. 10, 2023) (“Jackson I”). Instead, the court simply stated that\\n\\n        it believed it had correctly calculated the Guidelines and found Jackson’s case to be “a\\n\\n        typical case contemplated by the [G]uidelines.” S.A. 19. 3\\n\\n                                                     2.\\n\\n               Jackson appealed his sentence, continuing to argue that his prior South Carolina\\n\\n        drug distribution convictions are not controlled substance offenses under the Guidelines.\\n\\n        South Carolina’s statute, Jackson explained, defines “distribute” as “deliver,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">S.C. Code\\n\\n        Ann. § 44-53-110</span><pre class=\"inline\">(17), and “deliver or delivery” to include the “attempted transfer” of a\\n\\n        controlled substance, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at § 44-53-110(10) (defining “‘deliver’ or ‘delivery’” as an\\n\\n\\n               3\\n                 “S.A.” refers to the supplemental appendix filed by the government. “J.A.” refers\\n        to the joint appendix filed by both parties.\\n                                                     5\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580        Doc: 42       Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 6 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        “actual, constructive, or attempted transfer”). It follows, he argued, that South Carolina’s\\n\\n        statute, like the West Virginia statute reviewed in Campbell, reaches attempted delivery of\\n\\n        a controlled substance, broadening it beyond the Guidelines definition of controlled\\n\\n        substance offense.\\n\\n               In an unpublished opinion, we agreed with Jackson. Jackson I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 WL 2852624</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\\n\\n        at *3. Under Campbell, we reasoned, a state controlled substances law that sweeps in\\n\\n        inchoate attempt offenses goes beyond the conduct covered by the Guidelines definition in\\n\\n        § 4B1.2(b) and is therefore not a controlled substance offense under Guideline\\n\\n        § 2K2.1(a)(1). Id. at *3. And South Carolina’s “distribution” offense, we concluded, like\\n\\n        West Virginia’s, reaches attempted deliveries outside the scope of § 4B1.2(b). Id. We\\n\\n        were not persuaded by the government’s argument that under South Carolina’s law an\\n\\n        “attempted transfer” is not equivalent to an attempted delivery, but instead refers to a\\n\\n        completed delivery, nor by the government’s other efforts to distinguish Campbell. Id. at\\n\\n        *3–5. Accordingly, we vacated Jackson’s sentence and remanded for resentencing. Id. at\\n\\n        *6.\\n\\n                                                    B.\\n\\n               Almost immediately after our unpublished decision in Jackson – but before\\n\\n        Jackson’s resentencing – we issued two published decisions of importance here.\\n\\n               First, in United States v. Groves, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">65 F.4th 166</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174 (4th Cir. 2023), we held that\\n\\n        Campbell notwithstanding, a drug distribution conviction under the federal controlled\\n\\n        substances statute, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">21 U.S.C. § 841</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a)(1), is a controlled substance offense under the\\n\\n        Guidelines. We recognized that the federal statute defines “distribute” as “deliver,” and\\n\\n                                                     6\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 7 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        “deliver” to include an “attempted transfer.”       65 F.4th at 172 (quoting </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">21 U.S.C.\\n\\n        §§ 802</span><pre class=\"inline\">(11), 802(8)). But we agreed with the government – and several other circuit courts\\n\\n        – that “attempted transfer” as used in the federal statute means a “completed delivery rather\\n\\n        than an attempt crime,” in part because the federal law separately criminalizes attempt\\n\\n        offenses. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (internal quotation marks omitted). That rendered the federal law “materially\\n\\n        different” from Campbell’s West Virginia law, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 173</span><pre class=\"inline\">, and made it a categorical match\\n\\n        for a Guidelines controlled substance offense, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 174</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In a footnote, we rejected the\\n\\n        defendant’s reliance on Jackson I, an unpublished decision without precedential effect. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\\n\\n        at 173 n.4.\\n\\n               Next came United States v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">75 F.4th 428</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443 (4th Cir. 2023), in which we\\n\\n        considered the very same South Carolina statute now at issue, § 44-53-375(B), and held\\n\\n        that a distribution violation constitutes a controlled substance offense as defined by the\\n\\n        Guidelines. We rejected the defendant’s argument that “we [we]re bound by Campbell to\\n\\n        conclude that a South Carolina Code [§] 44-53-375(B) ‘distribution’ offense criminalizes\\n\\n        the attempt offense of attempted distribution” and is thus broader than the Guidelines\\n\\n        definition. Id. at 444. Instead, we followed Groves: Like the federal statue in Groves, we\\n\\n        reasoned, South Carolina law separately codifies the offense of attempted distribution; and\\n\\n        under South Carolina law, like federal law, an “attempted transfer” of drugs is a “completed\\n\\n        distribution,” not an attempted one. Id. at 443. Because South Carolina’s § 44-53-375(B)\\n\\n        distribution offense does not in fact reach attempt offenses, it is “materially\\n\\n        distinguishable” from West Virginia’s law as understood in Campbell, and a distribution\\n\\n        conviction under § 44-53-375(B) categorically qualifies as a Guidelines controlled\\n\\n                                                     7\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 8 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        substance offense. Id. at 445. Again, we declined to follow Jackson I – decided, we noted,\\n\\n        without the benefit of the Groves precedent – as an unpublished and nonprecedential\\n\\n        decision. Id. at 444 n.15.\\n\\n                                                     C.\\n\\n               That brings us, finally, to Jackson’s resentencing, from which the current appeal\\n\\n        arises. About a month after our decision in Davis, the probation office issued a revised\\n\\n        PSR. The PSR continued to treat Jackson’s prior South Carolina convictions as controlled\\n\\n        substance offenses, and again calculated a Guidelines range of 110 to 120 months’\\n\\n        imprisonment. The probation office rejected Jackson’s argument that it was bound by the\\n\\n        mandate rule to give effect to Jackson I, reasoning that our intervening decision in Davis\\n\\n        constituted a dramatic change in the law.\\n\\n               Before the district court, Jackson again objected, arguing that Jackson I prohibited\\n\\n        the court from counting his South Carolina convictions as Guidelines “controlled substance\\n\\n        offense[s].” He recognized that an exception to the mandate rule applies when “controlling\\n\\n        legal authority has changed dramatically,” see United States v. Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652927\"><a href=\"/opinion/652927/united-states-v-george-robert-bell/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. George Robert Bell\">5 F.3d 64</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (4th Cir.\\n\\n        1993), and that Davis marked a change from the earlier decision in Jackson I. Nevertheless,\\n\\n        Jackson contended, there was no cognizable change because Davis is not “controlling legal\\n\\n        authority”: Davis is in irreconcilable conflict with Campbell; Campbell, as the earlier panel\\n\\n        opinion, controls; and Davis is therefore without effect for purposes of the mandate rule,\\n\\n        leaving the district court bound by Jackson I.\\n\\n               Without an enhanced base offense level predicated on his South Carolina\\n\\n        convictions, Jackson again explained, his Guidelines sentencing range would fall to 63 to\\n\\n                                                     8\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42         Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 9 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        78 months’ imprisonment. Jackson urged the district court to impose a sentence within\\n\\n        that range, either as a within-Guidelines sentence following Jackson I or, if the district\\n\\n        court decided to follow Davis, as a downward variant sentence. In arguing that the </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18\\n\\n        U.S.C. § 3553</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a) factors supported such a sentence, Jackson relied primarily on his post-\\n\\n        sentencing conduct while in custody: Jackson had been on excellent behavior, with no\\n\\n        disciplinary infractions, and had been taking job skills classes and working toward a GED.\\n\\n        Jackson also argued that his criminal history score fully accounted for his prior offenses\\n\\n        and that he would return to a loving family home – a fiancée and four children – upon\\n\\n        release.\\n\\n               The district court overruled Jackson’s objection and decided to “follow the Davis\\n\\n        decision,” calling this an “easy” question. J.A. 22. Davis, the court noted – unlike\\n\\n        Campbell – “actually dealt with the South Carolina statute” at issue, J.A. 22–23, making\\n\\n        clear that a violation of § 44-53-375(B) qualifies as a controlled substance offense under\\n\\n        the Guidelines definition. The court agreed with the government that the exception to the\\n\\n        mandate rule for changes in the law applied, and that it should adhere to Davis rather than\\n\\n        to Jackson I. Accordingly, it adopted the PSR advisory sentencing range of 110 to 120\\n\\n        months’ imprisonment.\\n\\n               The court again sentenced Jackson to a 115-month prison term. And again, its\\n\\n        discussion was brief. The court “incorporate[d] my comments and all of the record that\\n\\n        was before me incorporated into this adjudication of his sentence,” spelled out Jackson’s\\n\\n        offense level and criminal history category, and said it had “considered those factors under\\n\\n        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.S.C. § 3553</span><pre class=\"inline\">(a).” J.A. 23.

According to Jackson, the district court erred in two of these\\n\\n        respects: by improperly calculating his Guidelines range and by failing to adequately\\n\\n        explain its sentence. For the reasons given below, we disagree with Jackson’s first claim\\n\\n        but agree with his second, and we therefore vacate Jackson’s sentence and remand for\\n\\n        resentencing.\\n\\n                                                      A.\\n\\n               Jackson argues first that the district court incorrectly used his prior drug distribution\\n\\n        convictions under South Carolina’s § 44-53-375(B) to increase his Guidelines base offense\\n\\n        level, treating them as controlled substance offenses contrary to our controlling decision in\\n\\n        Campbell. We review de novo whether a prior conviction qualifies as a controlled\\n\\n        substance offense under the Sentencing Guidelines, see Davis, 75 F.4th at 441, and we\\n\\n        agree with the district court that Jackson’s South Carolina convictions so qualify.\\n\\n               Because this is Jackson’s second appeal of his sentence, we begin with the mandate\\n\\n        rule. The parties do not dispute the rule’s contours as they apply here. They agree that\\n\\n\\n                                                      10\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580        Doc: 42       Filed: 01/31/2025      Pg: 11 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        under ordinary circumstances, the district court would have been required to carry out the\\n\\n        mandate of Jackson I on remand, treating Jackson’s South Carolina convictions as outside\\n\\n        the Guidelines definition of a controlled substance offense and lowering Jackson’s base\\n\\n        offense level accordingly. See Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652927\"><a href=\"/opinion/652927/united-states-v-george-robert-bell/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v.

And they agree that there has been a “change” in\\n\\n        the law here – that after our unpublished decision in Jackson I, we changed course in Davis,\\n\\n        expressly declining to follow Jackson I and instead holding in a published opinion that a\\n\\n        conviction under South Carolina’s § 44-53-375(B) qualifies as a Guidelines controlled\\n\\n        substance offense.\\n\\n               But while there may have been a “change,” Jackson argues, there was not a change\\n\\n        in “controlling legal authority,” because Davis is not “controlling.” Instead, Jackson\\n\\n        argues, because there is an irreconcilable conflict between Davis and the earlier-decided\\n\\n        Campbell, Campbell continues to control. See McMellon v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">387 F.3d 329</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\\n\\n        333 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (“When published panel opinions are in direct conflict on a\\n\\n        given issue, the earliest opinion controls[.]”). The parties’ dispute, in other words, is not\\n\\n        about the mandate rule but about the status of Davis: According to Jackson, Davis is\\n\\n        without “legal authority” – taking it outside the mandate rule exception – because it cannot\\n\\n        be reconciled with our earlier decision in Campbell.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                     11\\n\\x0cUSCA4 Appeal: 23-4580      Doc: 42          Filed: 01/31/2025     Pg: 12 of 16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n               As the district court observed, this may be an “interesting dynamic,” but it is also\\n\\n        an “easy” question, J.A. 22, because Jackson’s argument is foreclosed by Davis itself. We\\n\\n        considered precisely this issue in Davis, in which the defendant argued – just as Jackson\\n\\n        does here – that the West Virginia statute in Campbell and South Carolina’s drug\\n\\n        distribution statute are “materially indistinguishable,” and that we were therefore “bound\\n\\n        by Campbell” to conclude that a distribution conviction under South Carolina’s § 44-53-\\n\\n        375(B) does not qualify as a Guidelines controlled substance offense. Davis, 75 F.4th at\\n\\n        444. But we held to the contrary, finding that Campbell is not controlling when it comes\\n\\n        to the South Carolina statute. Id. at 444–45. We of course recognized Campbell’s core\\n\\n        holding that “an attempt offense cannot be a ‘controlled substance offense,’ as defined in\\n\\n        Guidelines [§] 4B1.2(b).” Id. at 441–42. 4 That holding did not apply to § 44-53-375(B),\\n\\n        however: The “South Carolina statutory scheme” is “materially distinguishable” from\\n\\n        West Viriginia’s in that it does not reach attempted distribution offenses, making Campbell\\n\\n        likewise distinguishable. Id. at 445.\\n\\n               That holding squarely governs here.         Davis has already decided that South\\n\\n        Carolina’s drug distribution statute is materially different from the West Virginia statute at\\n\\n        issue in Campbell. The purported “conflict” between Campbell and Davis on which\\n\\n        defendant’s entire argument rests does not exist, for the reasons given by Davis. Jackson\\n\\n        may disagree with Davis’s analysis, but Davis is published, binding authority. And when\\n\\n\\n\\n               4\\n                To avoid any confusion, we note again that the Sentencing Commission has since\\n        amended the Guidelines definition of controlled substance offense so that it now includes\\n        inchoate attempt offenses.

See ECF No. 1-2 at 16–17, 20–22; ECF No. 6 at 2. On January 8, 2025, Plaintiff\\n\\nfiled a pro se “complaint and request for injunction” against the United States of America, Pru-\\n\\ndential Financial, Inc., one of that company’s employees, and the Department of Justice, seeking\\n\\n“the immediate termination of the baseless prosecution initiated” against him. ECF No. 1 at 1, 24.\\n\\nPlaintiff alleges he is being “prosecuted on baseless charges stemming from falsified surveillance\\n\\nfootage” that “has been concealed[] and manipulated” and “continues to be used against [him],”\\n\\nand that the Department of Justice “failed to investigate or intervene.” Id. at 5. These facts, he\\n\\ncontends, give rise to claims for malicious prosecution under the Federal Tort Claims Act, obstruc-\\n\\ntion of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503, and due-process violations under the Fifth Amendment,\\n\\nand thus entitle him to an order dismissing the “ongoing malicious prosecution” and prohibiting\\n\\n“further reliance on” the fabricated evidence “in any judicial or administrative proceeding,” and\\n\\nmonetary damages. ECF No. 1 at 5, 15–17; see also ECF No. 6 at 3 (requesting “an immediate\\n\\nstay of” orders by the New Jersey Superior Court and a temporary restraining order preventing\\n\\n“enforcement of pretrial conditions”).\\n\\x0c       The Court will dismiss the case sua sponte for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a\\n\\nclaim. See Evans v. Suter, No. 09-5242, 2010 WL 1632902, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 2, 2010) (per\\n\\ncuriam) (“[A] district court may dismiss a complaint sua sponte prior to service on the defendants\\n\\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) when, as here, it is evident that the court lacks subject-matter\\n\\njurisdiction.”); Perry v. Discover Bank, 514 F.

That is, to the extent Plaintiff is asking for injunctive relief directed at\\n\\nhis prosecution in New Jersey state court, he has named no state officials involved in that proceed-\\n\\ning. Even if he did, the Court would abstain from exercising jurisdiction given the “strong policy\\n\\nagainst federal court interference with pending state judicial proceedings”—particularly criminal\\n\\nones—“absent extraordinary circumstances.” MPAC, LLC v. District of Columbia, 181 F. Supp.\\n\\n3d 81, 84 (D.D.C. 2014) (citing Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971)); see also McElroy v. Lake\\n\\nCnty. Sheriff’s Off., No. 22-cv-3260 (CRC), 2023 WL 130735, at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 4, 2023). Indeed,\\n\\n“federal courts must refuse to intervene in state criminal proceedings to suppress the use of evi-\\n\\ndence claimed to have been obtained through unlawful means,” Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117,\\n\\n130 (1975) (emphasis added), which is what Plaintiff appears to ask for here. Nor has Plaintiff\\n\\nmade any “showing of bad faith, harassment, or some other extraordinary circumstance that would\\n\\nmake abstention inappropriate.” Middlesex Cnty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass’n, 457\\n\\nU.S. 423, 435 (1982). He contends only that “the fabrication of evidence and prosecutorial mis-\\n\\nconduct . . . warrant[] federal intervention,” ECF No. 6 at 3, but such “bald” and “conclusory as-\\n\\nsertions” do not amount to “extraordinary circumstances,” Klayman v. Porter, No. 22-cv-953\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  2\\n\\x0c(RBW), 2023 WL 2496738, at *7–8 (D.D.C.

So, insofar as Plaintiff asks the Court\\n\\nto intervene in his criminal prosecution, it has no basis to do so here.\\n\\n       To the extent Plaintiff asserts claims that do not require abstention, they must be dismissed\\n\\nfor separate reasons. For one thing, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s FTCA claim\\n\\nagainst the United States because “all [six] elements” listed in the statute “are also jurisdictional,”\\n\\nBrownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, 217 (2021), and Plaintiff does not even attempt to allege most\\n\\nof them, see 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b). In fact, any FTCA claim based on the tort of malicious prose-\\n\\ncution would fail because he is not being prosecuted by the federal government. Nor does any\\n\\nFTCA claim lie against the private entities he sues, see 28 U.S.C. § 2674, or against the DOJ, see\\n\\nLovelien v. United States, 422 F. Supp. 3d 341, 351 (D.D.C. 2019) (“[FTCA] suits must still pro-\\n\\nceed against the United States, not the officers or their agencies.”). And insofar as Plaintiff sues\\n\\nany of the defendants under 18 U.S.C. § 1503, that claim must be dismissed because “there is no\\n\\nprivate right of action under” that criminal statute. Semiani v. Dep’t of State, No. 13-cv-1180\\n\\n(TFH), 2013 WL 3984583, at *1 (D.D.C. Aug. 1, 2013) (quoting Banks v. Kramer, No. 09-5140,\\n\\n2009 WL 5526780, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 30, 2009)). What remains are vague allegations of vio-\\n\\nlations of his Fifth Amendment rights. See ECF No. 1 at 17. But “private actor[s]” who are “acting\\n\\nin their private capacities[] cannot be guilty of violating” the Constitution. Avila v. CitiMortgage,\\n\\nInc., 45 F.

Appellant argues that the circuit court abused its discretion by\\n\\nordering attorney fees without adjudicating pending motions, and without\\n\\nconsidering the financial resources of both parties as required by Kentucky\\n\\x0cRevised Statute (“KRS”) 403.220. After careful review, we find no error and\\n\\naffirm the order on appeal.\\n\\n                   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\\n\\n             On September 19, 2011, Appellee filed a petition for custody,\\n\\nvisitation, and child support. On March 8, 2012, the parties entered an agreed\\n\\norder memorializing a mediated resolution of various issues including child\\n\\nsupport, parenting time, and allocation of federal and state tax deductions. Per the\\n\\norder, Appellee would utilize the dependent child deduction on even-numbered\\n\\nyears, with Appellant using the deduction on odd-numbered years.\\n\\n             In early 2023, Appellant filed her 2022 federal and state income tax\\n\\nreturns, and utilized the dependent child deduction in violation of the agreed order.\\n\\nOn May 16, 2023, Appellee moved to hold Appellant in contempt for failing to\\n\\ncomply with the 2012 agreed order. Appellant did not respond to this motion and\\n\\nthe motion was granted by way of an order entered on May 23, 2023, Appellant\\n\\nwas found in contempt for violating the agreed order and directed her to\\n\\nimmediately file amended 2022 returns which did not utilize the child deduction.\\n\\nThe following month, Appellant filed motions to alter, amend, or vacate the May\\n\\n23, 2023, order and to modify support and parenting time. The same month the\\n\\ncircuit court filed a mediation order, which held all pending motions in abeyance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -2-\\n\\x0c              On November 27, 2023, Appellee filed a second motion to compel\\n\\nAppellant to file the amended tax returns because she had not filed amended\\n\\nreturns as previously ordered on May 23, 2023. Appellant filed the amended\\n\\nreturns on December 18, 2023 – approximately seven months after first being\\n\\nordered to file the amendment.\\n\\n              On January 9, 2024, Appellee filed a motion seeking attorney fees\\n\\narising from Appellant’s failure to comply with the agreed order and the May 23,\\n\\n2023, order directing her to file amended 2022 income tax returns. On February\\n\\n21, 2024, the Jefferson Circuit Court entered an order directing Appellant to pay\\n\\nattorney fees in the amount of $2,430.00 to Appellee and his attorney, Hon. Dennis\\n\\nSims (“Mr. Sims”). These fees represented nine hours of billable time incurred by\\n\\nAppellant’s violation of the 2012 agreed order, and Appellee’s subsequent motions\\n\\nto compel. In support of the order, the circuit court found that the award of\\n\\nattorney fees was appropriate under KRS 403.220, and rejected Appellant’s\\n\\nargument that the court improperly failed to rule on other pending motions and that\\n\\nthose issues should be resolved via mediation. This appeal followed.1\\n\\n\\n1\\n  In No. 09-CI-503760, Appellant’s biological parents, Karen and Allen Farmer, who are not\\nparties to the instant appeal, filed a petition in Jefferson Circuit Court seeking custody of\\nAppellant and Appellee’s child, or in the alternative to be awarded grandparent visitation. That\\nmatter was resolved by the entry of an agreed order entered on October 10, 2010, which granted\\ngrandparent visitation to Karen and Allen Farmer. A separate action, No. 11-CI-503233, was\\ncommenced on September 19, 2011, when Appellee filed a petition for custody, visitation and\\nchild support against Appellant in Jefferson Circuit Court. On October 29, 2014, the Jefferson\\nCircuit Court entered an order consolidating the two actions, and directing that any subsequent\\n\\n                                               -3-\\n\\x0c                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n              [T]he amount of an award of attorney’s fees is committed\\n              to the sound discretion of the trial court with good\\n              reason. That court is in the best position to observe\\n              conduct and tactics which waste the court’s and\\n              attorneys’ time and must be given wide latitude to\\n              sanction or discourage such conduct.\\n\\nSmith v. McGill, 556 S.W.3d 552, 556 (Ky. 2018) (internal quotation marks and\\n\\ncitation omitted). Accordingly, we review for an abuse of discretion. An abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion occurs if the court’s ruling is “arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, or\\n\\nunsupported by sound legal principles.” Commonwealth v. English, 993 S.W.2d\\n\\n941, 945 (Ky. 1999) (citations omitted).\\n\\n                           ARGUMENTS AND ANALYSIS\\n\\n              Appellant argues that the Jefferson Circuit Court committed reversible\\n\\nerror in its February 21, 2024, order directing her to pay attorney fees in the\\n\\namount of $2,430.00 to Appellee and his counsel, Mr. Sims. The focus of\\n\\nAppellant’s argument is her contention that the circuit court improperly failed to\\n\\nrule upon pending motions and should have waited for mediation to be conducted\\n\\nprior to ordering attorney fees. Specifically, Appellant notes that the circuit court\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npleadings shall be filed in the senior action, No. 09-CI-503760. Thereafter, some pleadings were\\nstyled with both Nos. 09-CI-503760 and 11-CI-503233, while others showed only No. 11-CI-\\n503233. Though the matters remain consolidated by virtue of the October 29, 2014 order,\\nAppellant’s Notice of Appeal designates the instant appeals as deriving solely from No. 11-CI-\\n503233.\\n\\n                                              -4-\\n\\x0cdid not rule upon her motion to alter, amend or vacate the May 23, 2023, order\\n\\ndirecting her to file amended tax returns, and did not wait for mediation before\\n\\nentering the award of attorney fees. That mediation was ordered to resolve all\\n\\npending motions and remaining issues, including Appellant’s motion to modify\\n\\ncustody. Appellant asserts that the circuit court record is unclear and created\\n\\n“room . . . for genuine misunderstanding by the parties.” The corpus of\\n\\nAppellant’s argument appears to be that since the order of mediation held all\\n\\npending matters in abeyance, she was no longer required to file amended income\\n\\ntax returns until mediation had been conducted. Appellant contends that prior\\n\\ncounsel for both parties were unaware that certain orders had been filed, and that\\n\\nthese orders did not appear on the Courtnet database. She also argues that the\\n\\naward of attorney fees improperly punished her, and that the court failed to\\n\\nconsider the financial resources of the parties as required by KRS 403.220.\\n\\n               In response, Appellee states that the Jefferson Circuit Court\\n\\nimproperly relied on KRS 403.220, because his motions to compel “neither\\n\\nimplicated nor mentioned” the statute. He asserts that even though the wrong\\n\\nstatute was employed, we may affirm the award of attorney fees because the\\n\\ncorrect result was reached.2\\n\\n\\n2\\n Appellee also argues that we should strike Appellant’s brief and dismiss her appeal based on\\nher failure to comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure in the filing of her appellate brief.\\nWhen a party fails to abide by the Rules of Appellate Procedure, we may choose “(1) to ignore\\n\\n                                                -5-\\n\\x0c               It is uncontroverted that the parties entered into an agreed order under\\n\\nwhich Appellant could use the child deduction on her income taxes only in odd-\\n\\nnumbered years. It is also not in dispute that Appellant violated the agreement by\\n\\nclaiming the deduction on her 2022 tax returns.\\n\\n               As a result, Appellee incurred attorney fees when his counsel\\n\\nmotioned the circuit court on May 16, 2023, to compel Appellant to file amended\\n\\ntax returns to comply with the agreed order. On May 23, 2023, the circuit court\\n\\nentered an order sustaining Appellee’s motion and directing Appellant to file\\n\\namended tax returns conforming to the agreed order. It is not disputed that\\n\\nAppellee did not file amended tax returns in compliance with the court’s ruling.\\n\\n               During the months that followed, Appellant filed various motions but\\n\\nnever complied with the circuit court’s May 23, 2023, order. On November 27,\\n\\n2023, Appellee filed a second motion to hold Appellant in contempt and directing\\n\\nher to file the amended tax returns. The motion was granted on December 4, 2023,\\n\\nand Appellant filed amended tax returns about two weeks later.\\n\\n               We find no error in the Jefferson Circuit Court’s awarding attorney\\n\\nfees to Appellee prior to adjudicating other pending motions, and before\\n\\n\\n\\nthe deficiency and proceed with the review; (2) to strike the brief or its offending portions . . . ;\\nor (3) to review the issues raised in the brief for manifest injustice only[.]” Hallis v. Hallis, 328\\nS.W.3d 694, 696 (Ky. App. 2010) (citation omitted); see also Ford v. Commonwealth, 628\\nS.W.3d 147, 153-55 (Ky. 2021). We choose to ignore the deficiency and proceed with the\\nreview.\\n\\n                                                 -6-\\n\\x0cconducting additional mediation. The order on appeal resulted from Appellant’s\\n\\nclear violation of the agreed order, and subsequent failure to comply with the\\n\\ncircuit court’s May 23, 2023, order directing her to file amended tax returns.\\n\\nAppellant has not cited any order in the record staying the enforcement of the\\n\\nagreed order or May 23, 2023, order.\\n\\n              The Jefferson Circuit Court addressed Appellant’s claim that\\n\\nadditional mediation should occur prior to enforcement of the agreed order and\\n\\nMay 23, 2023, order. The court rejected this argument, noting that “the issue\\n\\nregarding the income tax returns stood separate and alone, i.e., same was not to be\\n\\naddressed at mediation.” The June 30, 2023, mediation order held all pending\\n\\nmotions in abeyance. The May 23, 2023, order directing Appellant to file\\n\\namended tax returns consistent with the 2012 agreed order did stand separate from\\n\\nthe later filed motions as to child support and parenting time. We find no error on\\n\\nthis issue.\\n\\n              Appellant goes on to argue that the Jefferson Circuit Court erred in\\n\\nfailing to consider the financial resources of both parties prior to entering the\\n\\naward of attorney fees. She also argues that the award was improperly punitive.\\n\\nOn this basis, she seeks an opinion reversing the order on appeal.\\n\\n              KRS 403.220 states:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          -7-\\n\\x0c              The Court from time to time after considering the\\n              financial resources of both parties may order a party to\\n              pay a reasonable amount for the cost to the other party of\\n              maintaining or defending any proceeding under this\\n              chapter and for attorney’s fees, including sums for legal\\n              services rendered and costs incurred prior to the\\n              commencement of the proceeding or after entry of\\n              judgment.

Appellant argues that the circuit court abused its discretion by\\n\\nordering attorney fees without adjudicating pending motions, and without\\n\\nconsidering the financial resources of both parties as required by Kentucky\\n\\x0cRevised Statute (“KRS”) 403.220. After careful review, we find no error and\\n\\naffirm the order on appeal.\\n\\n                   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\\n\\n             On September 19, 2011, Appellee filed a petition for custody,\\n\\nvisitation, and child support. On March 8, 2012, the parties entered an agreed\\n\\norder memorializing a mediated resolution of various issues including child\\n\\nsupport, parenting time, and allocation of federal and state tax deductions. Per the\\n\\norder, Appellee would utilize the dependent child deduction on even-numbered\\n\\nyears, with Appellant using the deduction on odd-numbered years.\\n\\n             In early 2023, Appellant filed her 2022 federal and state income tax\\n\\nreturns, and utilized the dependent child deduction in violation of the agreed order.\\n\\nOn May 16, 2023, Appellee moved to hold Appellant in contempt for failing to\\n\\ncomply with the 2012 agreed order. Appellant did not respond to this motion and\\n\\nthe motion was granted by way of an order entered on May 23, 2023, Appellant\\n\\nwas found in contempt for violating the agreed order and directed her to\\n\\nimmediately file amended 2022 returns which did not utilize the child deduction.\\n\\nThe following month, Appellant filed motions to alter, amend, or vacate the May\\n\\n23, 2023, order and to modify support and parenting time. The same month the\\n\\ncircuit court filed a mediation order, which held all pending motions in abeyance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -2-\\n\\x0c              On November 27, 2023, Appellee filed a second motion to compel\\n\\nAppellant to file the amended tax returns because she had not filed amended\\n\\nreturns as previously ordered on May 23, 2023. Appellant filed the amended\\n\\nreturns on December 18, 2023 – approximately seven months after first being\\n\\nordered to file the amendment.\\n\\n              On January 9, 2024, Appellee filed a motion seeking attorney fees\\n\\narising from Appellant’s failure to comply with the agreed order and the May 23,\\n\\n2023, order directing her to file amended 2022 income tax returns. On February\\n\\n21, 2024, the Jefferson Circuit Court entered an order directing Appellant to pay\\n\\nattorney fees in the amount of $2,430.00 to Appellee and his attorney, Hon. Dennis\\n\\nSims (“Mr. Sims”). These fees represented nine hours of billable time incurred by\\n\\nAppellant’s violation of the 2012 agreed order, and Appellee’s subsequent motions\\n\\nto compel. In support of the order, the circuit court found that the award of\\n\\nattorney fees was appropriate under KRS 403.220, and rejected Appellant’s\\n\\nargument that the court improperly failed to rule on other pending motions and that\\n\\nthose issues should be resolved via mediation. This appeal followed.1\\n\\n\\n1\\n  In No. 09-CI-503760, Appellant’s biological parents, Karen and Allen Farmer, who are not\\nparties to the instant appeal, filed a petition in Jefferson Circuit Court seeking custody of\\nAppellant and Appellee’s child, or in the alternative to be awarded grandparent visitation. That\\nmatter was resolved by the entry of an agreed order entered on October 10, 2010, which granted\\ngrandparent visitation to Karen and Allen Farmer. A separate action, No. 11-CI-503233, was\\ncommenced on September 19, 2011, when Appellee filed a petition for custody, visitation and\\nchild support against Appellant in Jefferson Circuit Court. On October 29, 2014, the Jefferson\\nCircuit Court entered an order consolidating the two actions, and directing that any subsequent\\n\\n                                               -3-\\n\\x0c                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n              [T]he amount of an award of attorney’s fees is committed\\n              to the sound discretion of the trial court with good\\n              reason. That court is in the best position to observe\\n              conduct and tactics which waste the court’s and\\n              attorneys’ time and must be given wide latitude to\\n              sanction or discourage such conduct.\\n\\nSmith v.

Accordingly, we review for an abuse of discretion. An abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion occurs if the court’s ruling is “arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, or\\n\\nunsupported by sound legal principles.” Commonwealth v.

The focus of\\n\\nAppellant’s argument is her contention that the circuit court improperly failed to\\n\\nrule upon pending motions and should have waited for mediation to be conducted\\n\\nprior to ordering attorney fees. Specifically, Appellant notes that the circuit court\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npleadings shall be filed in the senior action, No. 09-CI-503760. Thereafter, some pleadings were\\nstyled with both Nos. 09-CI-503760 and 11-CI-503233, while others showed only No. 11-CI-\\n503233. Though the matters remain consolidated by virtue of the October 29, 2014 order,\\nAppellant’s Notice of Appeal designates the instant appeals as deriving solely from No. 11-CI-\\n503233.\\n\\n                                              -4-\\n\\x0cdid not rule upon her motion to alter, amend or vacate the May 23, 2023, order\\n\\ndirecting her to file amended tax returns, and did not wait for mediation before\\n\\nentering the award of attorney fees. That mediation was ordered to resolve all\\n\\npending motions and remaining issues, including Appellant’s motion to modify\\n\\ncustody. Appellant asserts that the circuit court record is unclear and created\\n\\n“room . . . for genuine misunderstanding by the parties.” The corpus of\\n\\nAppellant’s argument appears to be that since the order of mediation held all\\n\\npending matters in abeyance, she was no longer required to file amended income\\n\\ntax returns until mediation had been conducted. Appellant contends that prior\\n\\ncounsel for both parties were unaware that certain orders had been filed, and that\\n\\nthese orders did not appear on the Courtnet database. She also argues that the\\n\\naward of attorney fees improperly punished her, and that the court failed to\\n\\nconsider the financial resources of the parties as required by KRS 403.220.\\n\\n               In response, Appellee states that the Jefferson Circuit Court\\n\\nimproperly relied on KRS 403.220, because his motions to compel “neither\\n\\nimplicated nor mentioned” the statute. He asserts that even though the wrong\\n\\nstatute was employed, we may affirm the award of attorney fees because the\\n\\ncorrect result was reached.2\\n\\n\\n2\\n Appellee also argues that we should strike Appellant’s brief and dismiss her appeal based on\\nher failure to comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure in the filing of her appellate brief.\\nWhen a party fails to abide by the Rules of Appellate Procedure, we may choose “(1) to ignore\\n\\n                                                -5-\\n\\x0c               It is uncontroverted that the parties entered into an agreed order under\\n\\nwhich Appellant could use the child deduction on her income taxes only in odd-\\n\\nnumbered years. It is also not in dispute that Appellant violated the agreement by\\n\\nclaiming the deduction on her 2022 tax returns.\\n\\n               As a result, Appellee incurred attorney fees when his counsel\\n\\nmotioned the circuit court on May 16, 2023, to compel Appellant to file amended\\n\\ntax returns to comply with the agreed order. On May 23, 2023, the circuit court\\n\\nentered an order sustaining Appellee’s motion and directing Appellant to file\\n\\namended tax returns conforming to the agreed order. It is not disputed that\\n\\nAppellee did not file amended tax returns in compliance with the court’s ruling.\\n\\n               During the months that followed, Appellant filed various motions but\\n\\nnever complied with the circuit court’s May 23, 2023, order. On November 27,\\n\\n2023, Appellee filed a second motion to hold Appellant in contempt and directing\\n\\nher to file the amended tax returns. The motion was granted on December 4, 2023,\\n\\nand Appellant filed amended tax returns about two weeks later.\\n\\n               We find no error in the Jefferson Circuit Court’s awarding attorney\\n\\nfees to Appellee prior to adjudicating other pending motions, and before\\n\\n\\n\\nthe deficiency and proceed with the review; (2) to strike the brief or its offending portions . . . ;\\nor (3) to review the issues raised in the brief for manifest injustice only[.]” Hallis v.

We affirm.\\n\\n             Castle and Elyse Litton are the parents of F.C. (“Child”), born in\\n\\n2018. Litton filed a domestic violence petition on behalf of herself and Child in\\n\\n2023. Litton and Castle were never married, and their relationship had ceased by\\n\\nthe time Litton sought the DVO. The family court appointed a guardian ad litem\\n\\nfor Child and conducted a bitter, protracted hearing held on three separate dates.\\n\\x0cWe decline to discuss the vast majority of the evidence presented during the\\n\\nhearing as it is not germane to the narrow issues before us.\\n\\n             During the hearing, Litton testified that Castle threw a bookshelf at\\n\\nher while she was pregnant. She also testified that Castle threw a crib at her while\\n\\nshe was holding Child. Litton said Child had viewed Castle punch holes in walls.\\n\\nLitton also described an incident where she and Child met Castle at a farmer’s\\n\\nmarket, but Child did not wish to be with Castle at that time. Litton said Castle\\n\\naggressively grabbed Child’s arm, which frightened Child. Litton said she had\\n\\nfeared for the safety of both herself and Child since her pregnancy.\\n\\n             Castle disputed, or attempted to contextualize, much of Litton’s\\n\\ntestimony. For example, he testified that he grabbed Child’s arm at the farmer’s\\n\\nmarket because she was lunging into a crowd. He testified that Litton had pushed\\n\\nthe crib into him instead of vice versa and that he had only rattled the bookshelf,\\n\\nnot thrown it. Finally, Castle denied having punched walls during his relationship\\n\\nwith Litton, though he admitted to having done so previously.\\n\\n             At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court stated it would issue a\\n\\nDVO on behalf of Litton and Child. The court generally stated it found Litton, not\\n\\nCastle, to be credible. The court stated it did not have to find something bad\\n\\nhappened to Child to protect Child. The court frankly admitted it was unsure what\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -2-\\n\\x0cChild had witnessed but expressed its belief that violence in a home impacts\\n\\nchildren even if the violence is not directed towards them.\\n\\n             The family court issued written findings of fact and conclusions of\\n\\nlaw and completed AOC (Administrative Office of the Courts) form order 275.3.\\n\\nIn the form order, the court checked boxes indicating Litton was the Petitioner on\\n\\nbehalf of herself and Child. The court checked boxes indicating it found “[f]or\\n\\nPetitioner, against Respondent in that it was established, by a preponderance of the\\n\\nevidence, that an act(s) of domestic violence and abuse . . . has occurred and may\\n\\nagain occur . . . .” The court granted a DVO for Litton and Child against Castle for\\n\\ntwo years.\\n\\n             The family court also issued separate findings of fact, in which the\\n\\ncourt stated it was “aware from its judicial knowledge and experience that children\\n\\nmay experience effects of domestic violence in the home even if the child is not the\\n\\ntarget of that violence” even though it was “unclear” what Child had witnessed.\\n\\n             Castle filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate which argued that the\\n\\ncourt had not mentioned “a single act of domestic violence towards the child” and\\n\\nhad not explained “why it holds the belief that domestic violence is likely to occur\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -3-\\n\\x0cagain with regards to the child.” The trial court denied the motion. Castle then\\n\\nfiled this appeal challenging the DVO only as it pertains to Child.1\\n\\n              Before we begin our analysis, we must quickly resolve Litton’s\\n\\nrequest that we strike Castle’s brief. We decline to do so. Castle’s brief was\\n\\ntechnically noncompliant under Kentucky Rule of Appellate Procedure (“RAP”)\\n\\n32(A)(4) because his preservation statement was not placed at the very beginning\\n\\nof his argument. However, we deem that to be a de minimis irregularity which\\n\\ndoes not warrant the imposition of sanctions. We also decline to impose sanctions\\n\\nfor Castle’s citation to an unpublished opinion.\\n\\n              Turning to the merits, the scope of our review is deferential:\\n\\n                    We review the entry of a DVO for whether the trial\\n              court’s finding of domestic violence was an abuse of\\n              discretion. McKinney v. McKinney, 257 S.W.3d 130, 133\\n              (Ky. App. 2008). Our review of the trial court’s factual\\n              findings is limited to whether they were clearly\\n              erroneous. Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure (“CR”)\\n              52.01; Hall v. Smith, 599 S.W.3d 451, 454 (Ky. App.\\n              2020). A trial court’s factual determination is not clearly\\n              erroneous if it is supported by substantial evidence,\\n              which is evidence of sufficient probative value to induce\\n              conviction in the minds of reasonable people . . . .\\n\\n                     A trial court is authorized to issue a DVO if it\\n              ‘finds by a preponderance of the evidence that domestic\\n              violence and abuse has occurred and may again\\n\\n1\\n “We have considered the parties’ extensive arguments and citations to authority but will discuss\\nonly the arguments and cited authorities we deem most pertinent, the remainder being without\\nmerit, irrelevant, or redundant.” Schell v. Young, 640 S.W.3d 24, 29 n.1 (Ky. App. 2021).\\n\\n\\n\\n                                              -4-\\n\\x0c             occur[.]’” Castle v. Castle, 567 S.W.3d 908, 915 (Ky.\\n             App. 2019) (quoting Kentucky Revised Statutes (“KRS”)\\n             403.740(1)). “The preponderance of the evidence\\n             standard is satisfied when sufficient evidence establishes\\n             the alleged victim was more likely than not to have been\\n             a victim of domestic violence.” Caudill v. Caudill, 318\\n             S.W.3d 112, 114 (Ky. App. 2010) (citing Baird v. Baird,\\n             234 S.W.3d 385, 387 (Ky. App. 2007)).\\n\\nJohnston v. Johnston, 639 S.W.3d 428, 431 (Ky. App. 2021).\\n\\n             We perceive the gist of Castle’s arguments to be that the family court\\n\\nfailed to find that Child was a victim of domestic violence that may again occur,\\n\\nand that the issuance of the DVO is contrary to precedent. We disagree.\\n\\n             The trial court did find that Child had been a victim of domestic\\n\\nviolence that may recur. The family court noted on form order AOC 275.3 that\\n\\nLitton was the Petitioner, on behalf of herself and Child. The family court also\\n\\nchecked boxes on that form to indicate it found that the Petitioner had been\\n\\nsubjected to domestic violence which may occur again. The court did not\\n\\nspecifically note that its finding that the “Petitioner” had been subjected to\\n\\ndomestic violence which may again occur pertained only to Litton. Accordingly,\\n\\nthe family court found that both Litton and Child – who the court had recognized\\n\\ncollectively comprised the “Petitioner” – had been victims of domestic violence\\n\\nwhich may recur.\\n\\n             That finding is amply supported by the evidence. Specifically, Litton\\n\\ntestified that Castle: threw a crib at Litton while she was holding Child, grabbed\\n\\n                                          -5-\\n\\x0cChild aggressively at a farmer’s market, and often punched walls in anger within\\n\\nChild’s viewpoint. See KRS 403.720(2)(a) (defining domestic violence and abuse\\n\\nin relevant part as “[p]hysical injury . . . or the infliction of fear of imminent\\n\\nphysical injury . . . .”). Though Castle disputed Litton’s version of events, the\\n\\nfamily court had the sole ability to believe Litton instead of Castle. See, e.g.,\\n\\nBissell v. Baumgardner, 236 S.W.3d 24, 30 (Ky. App. 2007). Because the family\\n\\ncourt’s findings are supported by sufficient evidence, we may not disturb them.\\n\\nJohnston, 639 S.W.3d at 432.\\n\\n              We reject Castle’s arguments that the trial court’s separate written\\n\\nfindings undermine or control the definitive conclusions made on AOC form\\n\\n275.3.2 Child’s tender years meant she could not testify as to what she viewed, or\\n\\nwhether she feared Castle would imminently inflict physical injury on her. Thus,\\n\\nin those separate findings, the family court forthrightly stated that it was unsure of\\n\\nexactly what Child had witnessed. The court expressed its belief that children are\\n\\nimpacted when reared in a home where domestic violence occurs, even if the\\n\\nviolence is not directly aimed at the children.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n Though Castle also discusses the family court’s oral remarks, under Kentucky law “an oral\\npronouncement is not a judgment until it is reduced to writing.” Brock v. Commonwealth, 407\\nS.W.3d 536, 538 (Ky. 2013). Consequently, a written judgment trumps any inconsistent or\\ncontrary oral statements made by a trial court. Id. Thus, we focus on the written judgment, not\\noral remarks which the court did not explicitly incorporate into the written judgment.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                              -6-\\n\\x0c             Of course, a DVO is properly issued on behalf of a person only if that\\n\\nperson has been a victim of domestic violence. Johnston, 639 S.W.3d at 431. But\\n\\nas we have discussed, Litton testified as to the domestic violence committed by\\n\\nCastle which directly involved Child. Therefore, though we do not disagree as a\\n\\ntheoretical matter that children are generally impacted by domestic violence\\n\\ntowards a parent, we need not examine whether domestic violence towards an adult\\n\\nin a household entitles a minor in that same household to a DVO.\\n\\n             Our conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the separate findings are\\n\\nnot essential. Our Supreme Court has emphasized that “the only essential facts”\\n\\nnecessary to issue a protective order “(1) whether an act of domestic violence and\\n\\nabuse . . . has occurred, and (2) whether it may occur again . . . . Any additional\\n\\nfactual findings the trial court makes in issuing a protective order are merely\\n\\nsupporting those ultimate factual findings and are not ‘essential.’” Smith v.\\n\\nMcCoy, 635 S.W.3d 811, 817 (Ky. 2021) (internal quotation marks and citation\\n\\nomitted). The family court made those two findings in AOC form 275.3. Nothing\\n\\nin the nonessential separate findings unmistakably contradicts those two core\\n\\nfindings.\\n\\n             The bottom line is clear, even if some of the precise details are hazy:\\n\\nthe court found in AOC form 275.3 that Child had been a victim of domestic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -7-\\n\\x0cviolence which may recur. Those findings are supported by substantial evidence,\\n\\nso we reject Castle’s sundry arguments about the separate findings.\\n\\n             Finally, we reject Castle’s argument that issuing the DVO here was\\n\\ncontrary to precedent. In Hamilton v. Milbry, 676 S.W.3d 42, 47 (Ky. App. 2023),\\n\\nwe reversed a DVO issued on behalf of a minor because the trial court had not\\n\\nappointed a guardian ad litem. We also briefly noted in closing that the petitioner\\n\\n“did not present any evidence or argument regarding the need for protection on\\n\\nbehalf of the child.” Id. Here, the court appointed a guardian ad litem for Child\\n\\nand Litton testified about violent acts, her fear and desire for protection for Child.\\n\\n             Our conclusion is also not changed by our unpublished opinion in\\n\\nWilson v. Wilson, No. 2023-CA-1263-ME, 2024 WL 2491699 (Ky. App. May 24,\\n\\n2024). In Wilson, we vacated a DVO issued on behalf of children because the\\n\\npetitioner “did not allege [the Respondent] ever posed any danger to the children.\\n\\nThus, the family court erred in including the children as other protected persons in\\n\\nthe DVO.” Id. at *5. Here, Litton testified about the danger she believed Castle\\n\\nposed to Child (and herself) and the violent acts in which Child was involved or\\n\\nwitnessed.\\n\\n             For the foregoing reasons, the Fayette Family Court is affirmed.\\n\\n             ALL CONCUR.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          -8-\\n\\x0cBRIEFS FOR APPELLANT:    BRIEF FOR APPELLEE:\\n\\nRachel D.

We disagree.\\n\\n             The trial court did find that Child had been a victim of domestic\\n\\nviolence that may recur. The family court noted on form order AOC 275.3 that\\n\\nLitton was the Petitioner, on behalf of herself and Child. The family court also\\n\\nchecked boxes on that form to indicate it found that the Petitioner had been\\n\\nsubjected to domestic violence which may occur again. The court did not\\n\\nspecifically note that its finding that the “Petitioner” had been subjected to\\n\\ndomestic violence which may again occur pertained only to Litton. Accordingly,\\n\\nthe family court found that both Litton and Child – who the court had recognized\\n\\ncollectively comprised the “Petitioner” – had been victims of domestic violence\\n\\nwhich may recur.\\n\\n             That finding is amply supported by the evidence. Specifically, Litton\\n\\ntestified that Castle: threw a crib at Litton while she was holding Child, grabbed\\n\\n                                          -5-\\n\\x0cChild aggressively at a farmer’s market, and often punched walls in anger within\\n\\nChild’s viewpoint. See KRS 403.720(2)(a) (defining domestic violence and abuse\\n\\nin relevant part as “[p]hysical injury . . . or the infliction of fear of imminent\\n\\nphysical injury . . . .”). Though Castle disputed Litton’s version of events, the\\n\\nfamily court had the sole ability to believe Litton instead of Castle. See, e.g.,\\n\\nBissell v. Baumgardner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2186169\"><a href=\"/opinion/2186169/bissell-v-baumgardner/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Bissell v.

Because the family\\n\\ncourt’s findings are supported by sufficient evidence, we may not disturb them.\\n\\nJohnston, 639 S.W.3d at 432.\\n\\n              We reject Castle’s arguments that the trial court’s separate written\\n\\nfindings undermine or control the definitive conclusions made on AOC form\\n\\n275.3.2 Child’s tender years meant she could not testify as to what she viewed, or\\n\\nwhether she feared Castle would imminently inflict physical injury on her. Thus,\\n\\nin those separate findings, the family court forthrightly stated that it was unsure of\\n\\nexactly what Child had witnessed. The court expressed its belief that children are\\n\\nimpacted when reared in a home where domestic violence occurs, even if the\\n\\nviolence is not directly aimed at the children.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n Though Castle also discusses the family court’s oral remarks, under Kentucky law “an oral\\npronouncement is not a judgment until it is reduced to writing.” Brock v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5113860\"><a href=\"/opinion/5285499/brock-v-commonwealth/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Brock v.

Johnston, 639 S.W.3d at 431. But\\n\\nas we have discussed, Litton testified as to the domestic violence committed by\\n\\nCastle which directly involved Child. Therefore, though we do not disagree as a\\n\\ntheoretical matter that children are generally impacted by domestic violence\\n\\ntowards a parent, we need not examine whether domestic violence towards an adult\\n\\nin a household entitles a minor in that same household to a DVO.\\n\\n             Our conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the separate findings are\\n\\nnot essential. Our Supreme Court has emphasized that “the only essential facts”\\n\\nnecessary to issue a protective order “(1) whether an act of domestic violence and\\n\\nabuse . . . has occurred, and (2) whether it may occur again . . . . Any additional\\n\\nfactual findings the trial court makes in issuing a protective order are merely\\n\\nsupporting those ultimate factual findings and are not ‘essential.’” Smith v.\\n\\nMcCoy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">635 S.W.3d 811</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 817 (Ky. 2021) (internal quotation marks and citation\\n\\nomitted). The family court made those two findings in AOC form 275.3. Nothing\\n\\nin the nonessential separate findings unmistakably contradicts those two core\\n\\nfindings.\\n\\n             The bottom line is clear, even if some of the precise details are hazy:\\n\\nthe court found in AOC form 275.3 that Child had been a victim of domestic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -7-\\n\\x0cviolence which may recur. Those findings are supported by substantial evidence,\\n\\nso we reject Castle’s sundry arguments about the separate findings.\\n\\n             Finally, we reject Castle’s argument that issuing the DVO here was\\n\\ncontrary to precedent. In Hamilton v. Milbry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">676 S.W.3d 42</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (Ky. App. 2023),\\n\\nwe reversed a DVO issued on behalf of a minor because the trial court had not\\n\\nappointed a guardian ad litem. We also briefly noted in closing that the petitioner\\n\\n“did not present any evidence or argument regarding the need for protection on\\n\\nbehalf of the child.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Here, the court appointed a guardian ad litem for Child\\n\\nand Litton testified about violent acts, her fear and desire for protection for Child.\\n\\n             Our conclusion is also not changed by our unpublished opinion in\\n\\nWilson v. Wilson, No. 2023-CA-1263-ME, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 WL 2491699</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. App. May 24,\\n\\n2024). In Wilson, we vacated a DVO issued on behalf of children because the\\n\\npetitioner “did not allege [the Respondent] ever posed any danger to the children.\\n\\nThus, the family court erred in including the children as other protected persons in\\n\\nthe DVO.” Id. at *5. Here, Litton testified about the danger she believed Castle\\n\\nposed to Child (and herself) and the violent acts in which Child was involved or\\n\\nwitnessed.\\n\\n             For the foregoing reasons, the Fayette Family Court is affirmed.\\n\\n             ALL CONCUR.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          -8-\\n\\x0cBRIEFS FOR APPELLANT:    BRIEF FOR APPELLEE:\\n\\nRachel D.

JONES, AND LAMBERT, JUDGES.\\n\\nJONES, L., JUDGE: Brenda Compton (Compton) appeals from an order of the\\n\\nFloyd Circuit Court that granted summary judgment in favor of Pop’s Chevrolet,\\n\\nInc. (PCI). We affirm the circuit court.\\n\\x0c                         Factual and Procedural Background\\n\\n              Compton purchased a used 2020 Dodge Charger from PCI in April\\n\\n2022.1 Prior to purchasing the vehicle, PCI provided her with a history via Carfax.\\n\\nCompton claims that at some point after the purchase, she took the vehicle to\\n\\nanother dealership where she obtained a vehicle history from Experian. The\\n\\nExperian report indicated the vehicle was previously stolen, the Vehicle\\n\\nIdentification Number (VIN) defaced, and a fraudulent VIN placed on the vehicle.\\n\\nThis information had not been contained in the Carfax report. Compton filed the\\n\\nunderlying complaint in the circuit court in February 2023, claiming that she “did\\n\\nnot get the benefit of her bargain” and wanted the sales contract rescinded and her\\n\\nmoney refunded. PCI filed a counterclaim for defamation based on alleged social\\n\\nmedia posts Compton made about PCI.\\n\\n              PCI propounded discovery requests on March 28, 2023, which\\n\\nincluded requests for admissions regarding various facts including the VIN, the\\n\\npurchase contract, and that Compton was not damaged by any alleged VIN\\n\\ndiscrepancy or any alleged prior theft of the vehicle. Compton failed to respond\\n\\nand PCI filed a motion to deem truth of facts admitted pursuant to Kentucky Rule\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n Throughout the record before us and in her brief to this Court, Compton asserts the vehicle was\\n“new.” However, the vehicle was two years old with over 14,000 miles when Compton\\npurchased it. The record indicates the vehicle was likely used as a rental at some point in its\\nhistory.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                              -2-\\n\\x0cof Civil Procedure (CR) 36.01.2 Compton did not file a response and did not\\n\\nappear at the hearing. The circuit court entered an order granting PCI’s motion for\\n\\nadmission. Shortly thereafter, PCI filed a motion for summary judgment. The\\n\\nparties filed briefs and the court heard that motion on August 4, 2023. On\\n\\nSeptember 13, 2023, the circuit court entered a written order granting summary\\n\\njudgment in favor of PCI. This appeal followed. Further facts will be developed\\n\\nas necessary.\\n\\n                                    Standard of Review\\n\\n               Generally, when a circuit court grants a motion for summary\\n\\njudgment, the standard of review for the appellate court is de novo because only\\n\\nlegal issues are involved. Hallahan v. The Courier-Journal, 138 S.W.3d 699, 705\\n\\n(Ky. App. 2004). We must consider the evidence of record in the light most\\n\\nfavorable to the non-movant (i.e., Compton) and determine whether the circuit\\n\\ncourt correctly found there was no genuine issues as to any material fact and that\\n\\nthe moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Scifres v. Kraft, 916\\n\\nS.W.2d 779, 781 (Ky. App. 1996). However, due to Compton’s briefing\\n\\ndeficiencies as explained below, we review only for manifest injustice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  Although this motion appears in the certified case history from the Floyd Circuit Clerk, it does\\nnot appear in the record before us.\\n\\n                                               -3-\\n\\x0c                                            Analysis\\n\\n                   Compton’s brief is deficient in several ways. First, there are no\\n\\ncitations to the record in her Statement of the Case as required by Kentucky Rules\\n\\nof Appellate Procedure (RAP) 32(A)(3); nor does Compton cite to the record in her\\n\\nArgument section, as required by RAP 32(A)(4). Finally, there is no preservation\\n\\nstatement at the beginning of her Argument, also required by RAP 32(A)(4).3\\n\\n                We have three options when a party fails comply with the appellate\\n\\nrules: “(1) to ignore the deficiency and proceed with the review; (2) to strike the\\n\\nbrief or its offending portions, [RAP 10(B)(3)]4; or (3) to review the issues raised\\n\\nin the brief for manifest injustice only, Elwell v. Stone, 799 S.W.2d 46, 47 (Ky.\\n\\nApp. 1990).” Hallis v. Hallis, 328 S.W.3d 694, 696 (Ky. App. 2010). The\\n\\nKentucky Supreme Court has explained that “[t]he manifest injustice standard of\\n\\nreview is reserved only for errors in appellate briefing related to the statement of\\n\\npreservation.” Ford v. Commonwealth, 628 S.W.3d 147, 155 (Ky. 2021).\\n\\nManifest injustice exists where there “is probability of a different result or error so\\n\\nfundamental as to threaten a defendant’s entitlement to due process of law.”\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  PCI argues that Compton’s arguments related to a rebuilt title are unpreserved. PCI is correct\\nthat there are no claims related to an alleged rebuilt title contained in Compton’s complaint. Our\\nreview of the record shows that Compton’s assertions regarding the title of the vehicle do not\\nappear until she filed a response to PCI’s motion to dismiss. It was also argued extensively at\\nthe hearing on August 4, 2023.\\n4\\n    Formerly CR 76.12(8)(a).\\n\\n                                               -4-\\n\\x0cMartin v. Commonwealth, 207 S.W.3d 1, 3 (Ky. 2006). “Manifest injustice is\\n\\nfound if the error seriously affected the ‘fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\\n\\nthe proceeding.’” McGuire v. Commonwealth, 368 S.W.3d 100, 112 (Ky. 2012)\\n\\n(quoting Martin, 207 S.W.3d at 4). Finally, “[r]equiring a statement of\\n\\npreservation saves this Court the time of canvassing the record in order to\\n\\ndetermine if the claimed error was properly preserved for appeal.” S.T. v. Cabinet\\n\\nfor Health and Family Services, 585 S.W.3d 769, 777 (Ky. App. 2019) (internal\\n\\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\\n\\n             Thus, due to Compton’s briefing deficiencies, we review only for\\n\\nmanifest injustice, and, accordingly, find none. It is well-settled law in Kentucky\\n\\nthat “where there is no sworn statement denying specifically the matters of which\\n\\nan admission is requested, or setting forth in detail why the party cannot truthfully\\n\\nadmit or deny those matters, they are deemed admitted and may be the basis for a\\n\\nsummary judgment.” Smather v. May, 379 S.W.2d 230, 232 (Ky. 1964). See also\\n\\nCR 36.01(2).\\n\\n             It is equally well settled that:\\n\\n              [A]ny matter admitted under the rule is held to be\\n             conclusively established unless the trial court permits the\\n             withdrawal or amendment of the admissions. CR 36.02.\\n             Thus, an inattentive party served with a request for\\n             admissions may run the risk of having judgment entered\\n             against him based upon the failure to respond.\\n\\nHarris v. Stewart, 981 S.W.2d 122, 124 (Ky. App. 1998).\\n\\n                                           -5-\\n\\x0c             Because of Compton’s failure to respond to PCI’s request for\\n\\nadmissions, PCI conclusively established the following facts: (1) the true VIN was\\n\\nlocated on the vehicle, in the sales contract, and in the title; and all VINs matched;\\n\\n(2) the vehicle was legally titled; and (3) any prior alleged theft of the vehicle did\\n\\nnot cause damage to Compton. Compton did not subsequently seek withdrawal or\\n\\namendment of the admissions. As a result, there were no genuine issues of\\n\\nmaterial facts and summary judgment was appropriate.\\n\\n                                     Conclusion\\n\\n             For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Floyd Circuit\\n\\nCourt dated September 13, 2023, granting summary judgement to PCI.\\n\\n\\n\\n             ALL CONCUR.\\n\\n\\n\\n BRIEF FOR APPELLANT:                       BRIEF FOR APPELLEE:\\n\\n Wolodymyr Cybriwsky                        C.V.

PCI filed a counterclaim for defamation based on alleged social\\n\\nmedia posts Compton made about PCI.\\n\\n              PCI propounded discovery requests on March 28, 2023, which\\n\\nincluded requests for admissions regarding various facts including the VIN, the\\n\\npurchase contract, and that Compton was not damaged by any alleged VIN\\n\\ndiscrepancy or any alleged prior theft of the vehicle. Compton failed to respond\\n\\nand PCI filed a motion to deem truth of facts admitted pursuant to Kentucky Rule\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n Throughout the record before us and in her brief to this Court, Compton asserts the vehicle was\\n“new.” However, the vehicle was two years old with over 14,000 miles when Compton\\npurchased it. The record indicates the vehicle was likely used as a rental at some point in its\\nhistory.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                              -2-\\n\\x0cof Civil Procedure (CR) 36.01.2 Compton did not file a response and did not\\n\\nappear at the hearing.

In attempting to comply with the terms of our order on remand, the court\\n\\nimposed additional fees never addressed in the first appeal. We conclude that the\\n\\x0ctrial court exceeded the scope of its authority on remand. Therefore, we vacate and\\n\\nremand this case to the trial court with specific instructions as set forth below.\\n\\n                The underlying facts are summarized in the prior appeal, Stone v.\\n\\nCommonwealth, No. 2022-CA-0394-MR, 2023 WL 2618525, at *1 (Ky. App.\\n\\nMar. 24, 2023), as follows in relevant part:\\n\\n                On March 18, 2022, Appellant was sentenced to two\\n                years in prison pursuant to a guilty plea. He was also\\n                ordered to pay $185 in court costs and a $25 bond fee, for\\n                a total of $210 in court costs and fees. Appellant had\\n                secured his release prior to sentencing by paying $150\\n                toward a partially secured bond. At sentencing, the court\\n                indicated that it was going to release the bond and apply\\n                the $150 toward the court costs and fees. Appellant was\\n                then ordered to pay the remainder of the costs and fees by\\n                March 1, 2023.\\n\\n(Footnotes omitted.)\\n\\n                Stone appealed on grounds that he was a poor person and that costs\\n\\nshould have been waived. Although the issue was not preserved, this Court\\n\\nreviewed it for palpable error pursuant to RCr110.26. Id. (citing Jones v.\\n\\nCommonwealth, 527 S.W.3d 820, 825 (Ky. App. 2017) (holding that imposition of\\n\\ncourt costs in violation of KRS2 23A.2053 constitutes palpable error)).\\n\\n\\n1\\n    Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure.\\n2\\n    Kentucky Revised Statutes.\\n3\\n KRS 23A.205(2) provides in relevant part that “taxation of court costs against a defendant,\\nupon conviction in a case, shall be mandatory . . . unless the court finds that the defendant is a\\npoor person as defined by KRS 453.190(2) and that he . . . is unable to pay court costs and will\\n\\n                                                -2-\\n\\x0c              In the prior appeal, this Court concluded that Stone was a poor person\\n\\nwho was entitled to have his court costs and bond fee waived. This Court vacated\\n\\nthat portion of Stone’s conviction which required him to pay court costs and the\\n\\nbond fee and remanded for entry of a new judgment and sentence waiving the\\n\\ncourt costs and bond fee.\\n\\n              However, on August 23, 2023, the trial court entered an Order\\n\\nwaiving “the Court Costs, and Bond Filing Fees in this action, Pursuant to the\\n\\nKentucky Court of Appeals [sic] Decision.”\\n\\n              On December 5, 2023, the trial court entered another Order as follows\\n\\nin relevant part:\\n\\n              [A]fter receipt of the Court of Appeal’s opinion, having\\n              entered an order on or about August 23, 2023, waiving\\n              the Court Costs and Filing Fees in this action, the Court\\n              having reviewed the file and finding that this Court needs\\n              to fully comply with the Court of Appeal’s [sic] Opinion,\\n              and enter a new Judgment and Sentence . . . .\\n\\nThe trial court stated that Stone’s presence at the hearing was necessary and\\n\\ndirected the Department of Corrections to make him available by Zoom or\\n\\ntransport him to the Ballard County Courthouse on December 15, 2023, “for\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbe unable to [do so] in the foreseeable future.” KRS 453.190(2) defines “poor person” as one\\nwho “is unable to pay the costs and fees of the proceeding in which he is involved without\\ndepriving himself or his dependents of the necessities of life, including food, shelter, or\\nclothing.”\\n\\n                                              -3-\\n\\x0cpurposes of re-sentencing in Case # 21-CR-122 [the instant case] and # 21-CR-\\n\\n121. Case No. 21-CR-121 was not appealed and is not before us.4\\n\\n                 On December 15, 2023, the trial court entered an Order continuing\\n\\nthe case to January 5, 2024, “to re-sentence the defendant in the above-referenced\\n\\ncases[5] and to have a hearing in regard to Ballad County having a Resolution to\\n\\ncollect jail fees. The Commonwealth shall have a representative of Ballard\\n\\nCounty available to testify on Jan 5 24.”\\n\\n                 On January 5, 2024, the trial court convened a hearing. On January\\n\\n5, 2024, the trial court entered an order in this case, No. 21-CR-00122, attaching a\\n\\ncopy of the Ballard County Fiscal Court resolution approving a jail fee ordinance\\n\\nestablishing a fee of $30.00 per day. The order reflects that Stone agreed to\\n\\nstipulate said fee policy and waived “any necessity for hearing.” The court further\\n\\nordered Stone to “reimburse Ballard County at the rate of $30.00 per day for each\\n\\nof the 21 days spent in incarceration prior to sentencing.”\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  Stone notes that we may take judicial notice of the final judgment entered in No. 21-CR-00121,\\na copy of which is appended to his Appellant’s brief, citing Kentucky Rule of Evidence (KRE)\\n201. The Rule permits judicial notice of adjudicative facts. The Commonwealth refers us to\\nCourtNet 2.0 regarding information about case No. 21-CR-00121, which, it states, is subject to\\njudicial notice. The parties are in agreement that in case No. 21-CR-00121, which originated on\\nthe same day as the case now before us, Stone was ordered to pay court costs, a bond fee, and jail\\nfees (21 days at $30 per day payable to Ballard County Detention Center). We take judicial\\nnotice of the Judgment and Sentence on Plea of Guilty entered on March 18, 2023, in Ballard\\nCircuit Court Case No. 21-CR-00121.\\n\\n5\\n    Both case numbers are included in the caption of that particular Order.\\n\\n                                                 -4-\\n\\x0c             On January 5, 2024, the trial court also entered an “Amended/\\n\\nResentenced Judgment and Sentence on Plea of Guilty” in this case on a Form\\n\\nAOC-445. The Amended Judgment reflects that the trial court waived court costs\\n\\n“due to Court of Appeals Order.” The trial court now ordered Stone to pay jail\\n\\nfees -- “21 Days at $30 a day to Ballard County.” It appears that the trial court\\n\\nalso ordered that the Defendant’s bond be used to cover its newly imposed jail fee.\\n\\nOn the form, the trial court marked the box “other” in the section about the\\n\\nDefendant’s bond and then wrote (as well as we can decipher): “jail (do not apply\\n\\nfor 2 months or before March 5 24[.)]”\\n\\n             Stone appeals. He first argues that the trial court erred on remand by\\n\\nexceeding its authority at resentencing.\\n\\n             [T]he mandate rule, a tenet of the law-of-the-case\\n             doctrine, . . . “provides that on remand from a higher\\n             court a lower court must obey and give effect to the\\n             higher court’s express or necessarily implied holdings\\n             and instructions.” Brown v. Commonwealth, 313 S.W.3d\\n             577, 610 (Ky. 2010) (citations omitted). In addition to\\n             serving litigants’ interests in finality, the mandate rule\\n             serves “the equally important interest courts have in\\n             judicial economy[ ] by preventing the drain on judicial\\n             resources that would result if previous decisions were\\n             routinely subject to reconsideration.” Id. “In a\\n             subsequent appeal following remand, this Court’s role is\\n             limited to whether the trial court properly construed and\\n             applied the mandate.” James v. James, 636 S.W.3d 549,\\n             554 (Ky. App. 2021) (citations omitted).\\n\\n                   There are two types of mandates: limited and\\n             general. See Monroe v. FTS USA, LLC, 17 F.4th 664,\\n\\n                                           -5-\\n\\x0c              669 (6th Cir. 2021), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 142 S.\\n              Ct. 1232, 212 L.

They may, for\\n              example, include wording such as, “this case is remanded\\n              with instructions to conduct further proceedings not\\n              inconsistent with this opinion” or similar language.

He was also\\n                ordered to pay $185 in court costs and a $25 bond fee, for\\n                a total of $210 in court costs and fees.

This Court vacated\\n\\nthat portion of Stone’s conviction which required him to pay court costs and the\\n\\nbond fee and remanded for entry of a new judgment and sentence waiving the\\n\\ncourt costs and bond fee.\\n\\n              However, on August 23, 2023, the trial court entered an Order\\n\\nwaiving “the Court Costs, and Bond Filing Fees in this action, Pursuant to the\\n\\nKentucky Court of Appeals [sic] Decision.”\\n\\n              On December 5, 2023, the trial court entered another Order as follows\\n\\nin relevant part:\\n\\n              [A]fter receipt of the Court of Appeal’s opinion, having\\n              entered an order on or about August 23, 2023, waiving\\n              the Court Costs and Filing Fees in this action, the Court\\n              having reviewed the file and finding that this Court needs\\n              to fully comply with the Court of Appeal’s [sic] Opinion,\\n              and enter a new Judgment and Sentence . . . .\\n\\nThe trial court stated that Stone’s presence at the hearing was necessary and\\n\\ndirected the Department of Corrections to make him available by Zoom or\\n\\ntransport him to the Ballard County Courthouse on December 15, 2023, “for\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbe unable to [do so] in the foreseeable future.” KRS 453.190(2) defines “poor person” as one\\nwho “is unable to pay the costs and fees of the proceeding in which he is involved without\\ndepriving himself or his dependents of the necessities of life, including food, shelter, or\\nclothing.”\\n\\n                                              -3-\\n\\x0cpurposes of re-sentencing in Case # 21-CR-122 [the instant case] and # 21-CR-\\n\\n121. Case No. 21-CR-121 was not appealed and is not before us.4\\n\\n                 On December 15, 2023, the trial court entered an Order continuing\\n\\nthe case to January 5, 2024, “to re-sentence the defendant in the above-referenced\\n\\ncases[5] and to have a hearing in regard to Ballad County having a Resolution to\\n\\ncollect jail fees. The Commonwealth shall have a representative of Ballard\\n\\nCounty available to testify on Jan 5 24.”\\n\\n                 On January 5, 2024, the trial court convened a hearing. On January\\n\\n5, 2024, the trial court entered an order in this case, No. 21-CR-00122, attaching a\\n\\ncopy of the Ballard County Fiscal Court resolution approving a jail fee ordinance\\n\\nestablishing a fee of $30.00 per day. The order reflects that Stone agreed to\\n\\nstipulate said fee policy and waived “any necessity for hearing.” The court further\\n\\nordered Stone to “reimburse Ballard County at the rate of $30.00 per day for each\\n\\nof the 21 days spent in incarceration prior to sentencing.”\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  Stone notes that we may take judicial notice of the final judgment entered in No. 21-CR-00121,\\na copy of which is appended to his Appellant’s brief, citing Kentucky Rule of Evidence (KRE)\\n201. The Rule permits judicial notice of adjudicative facts. The Commonwealth refers us to\\nCourtNet 2.0 regarding information about case No. 21-CR-00121, which, it states, is subject to\\njudicial notice. The parties are in agreement that in case No. 21-CR-00121, which originated on\\nthe same day as the case now before us, Stone was ordered to pay court costs, a bond fee, and jail\\nfees (21 days at $30 per day payable to Ballard County Detention Center). We take judicial\\nnotice of the Judgment and Sentence on Plea of Guilty entered on March 18, 2023, in Ballard\\nCircuit Court Case No. 21-CR-00121.\\n\\n5\\n    Both case numbers are included in the caption of that particular Order.\\n\\n                                                 -4-\\n\\x0c             On January 5, 2024, the trial court also entered an “Amended/\\n\\nResentenced Judgment and Sentence on Plea of Guilty” in this case on a Form\\n\\nAOC-445. The Amended Judgment reflects that the trial court waived court costs\\n\\n“due to Court of Appeals Order.” The trial court now ordered Stone to pay jail\\n\\nfees -- “21 Days at $30 a day to Ballard County.” It appears that the trial court\\n\\nalso ordered that the Defendant’s bond be used to cover its newly imposed jail fee.\\n\\nOn the form, the trial court marked the box “other” in the section about the\\n\\nDefendant’s bond and then wrote (as well as we can decipher): “jail (do not apply\\n\\nfor 2 months or before March 5 24[.)]”\\n\\n             Stone appeals. He first argues that the trial court erred on remand by\\n\\nexceeding its authority at resentencing.\\n\\n             [T]he mandate rule, a tenet of the law-of-the-case\\n             doctrine, . . . “provides that on remand from a higher\\n             court a lower court must obey and give effect to the\\n             higher court’s express or necessarily implied holdings\\n             and instructions.” Brown v.

We conclude that the recent amendment\\n\\nto Kentucky Revised Statute (“KRS”) 431.073 now permits the expungement of\\n\\ncertain multiple felony offenses, even if they did not arise from a single incident.\\n\\nSince the Trial Court clearly erred in finding that the offenses were not eligible for\\n\\x0cexpungement, we reverse and remand for additional proceedings on the merits of\\n\\nFarwick’s application.\\n\\n             On January 25, 1990, Farwick was convicted of 17 counts of\\n\\nObtaining a Controlled Substance through Fraud. The offenses arose from\\n\\nFarwick’s attempts to use fraudulent prescriptions at six different pharmacies\\n\\nbetween October 8, 1989, and November 27, 1989. All of the offenses are Class D\\n\\nfelonies. KRS 218A.140(5).\\n\\n             Subsequently, in 1994, the then-Governor of Kentucky bestowed upon\\n\\nFarwick a restoration of rights. On February 19, 2019, Farwick filed an\\n\\napplication to expunge his convictions and the charges (including a dismissed\\n\\ncount). On May 23, 2019, the Trial Court denied the application, concluding that\\n\\nKRS 431.073 does not apply to multiple felonies that do not arise from a single\\n\\nincident.\\n\\n             On May 25, 2023, Farwick filed a second application to expunge the\\n\\nsame charges. Farwick checked the box on the application stating that “the\\n\\noffenses are a series of eligible offenses listed in KRS 431.073(1)(a) which arose\\n\\nfrom a single incident.” Three days later, the Trial Court denied his second\\n\\napplication to expunge the convictions and charges on the same grounds as it\\n\\ndenied his first application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        -2-\\n\\x0c             On November 9, 2023, Farwick filed his third, and current,\\n\\napplication again seeking to expunge the convictions and charges. In this\\n\\napplication, Farwick relied upon a recent amendment to KRS 431.073(1)(d),\\n\\nwhich, among other things, allows expungement of “multiple felony offenses\\n\\neligible under this paragraph[.]” The Trial Court again denied the petition,\\n\\nconcluding that the statute still requires that multiple felonies arise out of a single\\n\\nincident. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth below as\\n\\nnecessary.\\n\\n             The sole question on appeal concerns the Trial Court’s interpretation\\n\\nof the current version of KRS 431.073. Since statutory interpretation is an issue of\\n\\nlaw, our review is de novo. Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. Fell, 391 S.W.3d 713,\\n\\n718 (Ky. 2012). “When interpreting a statute, the intent of the legislature is\\n\\nparamount and controls[,]” and “words are afforded their ordinary meaning unless\\n\\na contrary intent is apparent.” Wahlke v. Pierce, 392 S.W.3d 426, 430 (Ky. App.\\n\\n2013) (citing Old Lewis Hunter Distillery Co. v. Ky. Tax Comm’n, 302 Ky. 68, 193\\n\\nS.W.2d 464 (1945)). See also MPM Financial Group, Inc. v. Morton, 289 S.W.3d\\n\\n193, 197 (Ky. 2009).\\n\\n             The legislature has revised the expungement statute, KRS 431.073,\\n\\nseveral times since enactment in 2016. As originally enacted, subsection (1)\\n\\nprovided that any person who has been convicted of a specified Class D felony or a\\n\\n\\n                                           -3-\\n\\x0c“series of Class D felony violations of one (1) or more statutes enumerated in this\\n\\nsection arising from a single incident, . . . may file with the court in which he or\\n\\nshe was convicted an application to have the judgment vacated.” This Court\\n\\ninterpreted the statute in Commonwealth v. Ford, 543 S.W.3d 579 (Ky App. 2018),\\n\\nwhere the petitioner sought to expunge convictions for four counts of uttering a\\n\\nforged check. This Court concluded that the offenses were not eligible for\\n\\nexpungement, holding:\\n\\n              The fact that Ford’s charges were grouped in a single\\n              indictment does not mean they arose from a single\\n              incident. Passing bad checks on four different days at\\n              three different institutions over a ten-day period simply\\n              does not constitute a “single incident.”\\n\\nId. at 581.\\n\\n              In 2023, the General Assembly amended KRS 431.073(1), which now\\n\\nprovides as follows:\\n\\n              Any person who has been:\\n\\n                    (a) Convicted of a Class D felony violation of KRS\\n                        17.175, 186.990, 194A.505, 194B.505,\\n                        217.181, 217.207, 217.208, 218A.140,\\n                        218A.1415, 218A.1416, 218A.1417,\\n                        218A.1418, 218A.1423, 218A.1439, 218A.282,\\n                        218A.284, 218A.286, 218A.320, 218A.322,\\n                        218A.324, 218A.500, 244.165, 286.11-057,\\n                        304.47-025, 324.990, 365.241, 434.155,\\n                        434.675, 434.850, 434.872, 511.040, 512.020,\\n                        514.030, 514.040, 514.050, 514.060, 514.065,\\n                        514.070, 514.080, 514.090, 514.100, 514.110,\\n                        514.120, 514.140, 514.150, 514.160, 516.030,\\n\\n                                          -4-\\n\\x0c                       516.060, 516.090, 516.108, 517.120, 518.040,\\n                       522.040, 524.100, 525.113, 526.020, 526.030,\\n                       528.020, 528.040, 528.050, 530.010, or\\n                       530.050;\\n\\n                    (b) Convicted of a series of Class D felony\\n                        violations of one (1) or more statutes\\n                        enumerated in paragraph (a) of this subsection\\n                        arising from a single incident;\\n\\n                    (c) Granted a full pardon; or\\n\\n                    (d) Convicted of a Class D felony, or an offense\\n                        prior to January 1, 1975 which was punishable\\n                        by not more than five (5) years’ incarceration,\\n                        which was not a violation of KRS 189A.010,\\n                        508.032, or 519.055, abuse of public office, a\\n                        sex offense, or an offense committed against a\\n                        child, and did not result in serious bodily injury\\n                        or death; or of multiple felony offenses eligible\\n                        under this paragraph;\\n\\n             may file with the court in which he or she was convicted\\n             an application to have the judgment vacated.

The person shall be informed of the right\\n             at the time of adjudication.\\n\\n2023 Ky. Acts. Ch. 87, § 1 (eff. Jun. 29, 2023).\\n\\n             Although subsection (1)(b) still requires a showing of “a series of\\n\\nClass D felony violations . . . arising from a single incident[,]” Farwick notes that\\n\\nsubsection (1)(d) now allows expungement of “multiple felony offenses eligible\\n\\nunder this paragraph[.]” Thus, he argues that the plain language of the amended\\n\\nstatute permits expungement of his multiple Class D felony convictions. And\\n\\n\\n                                          -5-\\n\\x0cbecause the General Assembly designated that the changes in the expungement\\n\\nstatute were to be retroactive pursuant to KRS 431.073(12), he argues that the Trial\\n\\nCourt clearly erred by concluding that his felony offenses were not eligible for\\n\\nexpungement.\\n\\n              In response, the Commonwealth takes the position that Farwick’s\\n\\nexpungement claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Farwick filed his\\n\\nsecond application for expungement on August 25, 2023. Even though the 2023\\n\\namendment to KRS 431.073(1)(d) was already in effect, Farwick did not raise it in\\n\\nthat application. Rather, he only sought expungement based upon KRS\\n\\n431.073(1)(b) – the ground on which his application had already been denied. The\\n\\nCommonwealth maintains that the principles behind res judicata required him to\\n\\nraise all possible grounds at that time, and as a result his subsequent application\\n\\nwas barred.\\n\\n              The doctrine of res judicata provides that an existing final judgment\\n\\nrendered upon the merits is conclusive of causes of action and of facts or issues\\n\\nthereby litigated, as to the parties and their privies, in all other actions in the same\\n\\nor any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction. Yeoman v.\\n\\nCommonwealth, 983 S.W.2d 459, 464 (Ky. 1998). The purpose of the doctrine is\\n\\nto “preclude repetitious actions.” Miller v. Administrative Office of Courts, 361\\n\\nS.W.3d 867, 872 (Ky. 2011) (quoting Harrod v. Irvine, 283 S.W.3d 246, 250 (Ky.\\n\\n\\n                                           -6-\\n\\x0cApp. 2009)). Thus, the doctrine applies to prohibit the relitigating of claims that\\n\\nwere litigated or could have been litigated between the same parties in a prior\\n\\naction. Id. at 871.\\n\\n             However, res judicata is “an affirmative defense which operates to\\n\\nbar repetitious suits involving the same cause of action.” Yeoman, 983 S.W.2d at\\n\\n464. A party’s failure to raise an affirmative defense in a timely manner\\n\\nconstitutes a waiver of the defense. Am. Founders Bank, Inc. v. Moden Invs.,\\n\\nL.L.C., 432 S.W.3d 715, 722 (Ky. App. 2014). See also Kentucky Rule of Civil\\n\\nProcedure 8.03. In the absence of any showing that the Commonwealth raised this\\n\\ndefense to the Trial Court, we must conclude that it has been waived.\\n\\n             The clear language of the amended version of the statute allows\\n\\nexpungement of multiple Class D felonies, even those that do not arise from a\\n\\nsingle incident. Thus, the Trial Court clearly erred in concluding that they were\\n\\nnot eligible for expungement. As a result, we must remand this matter for further\\n\\nconsideration of Farwick’s expungement application.\\n\\n             Of course, the Commonwealth may still raise objections to\\n\\nexpungement of a conviction. KRS 431.073(4)(a). Furthermore, the Trial Court\\n\\nmust determine “that circumstances warrant vacation and expungement and that\\n\\nthe harm otherwise resulting to the applicant clearly outweighs the public interest\\n\\nin the criminal history record information being publicly available[.]” KRS\\n\\n\\n                                         -7-\\n\\x0c431.073(4)(c). The Trial Court has considerable discretion in weighing the\\n\\nstatutory factors in granting or denying the expungement. Walker v.\\n\\nCommonwealth, 696 S.W.3d 51, 56-57 (Ky. App. 2024). Since factual findings are\\n\\nwithin the Trial Court’s exclusive purview, we express no opinion on the merits of\\n\\nFarwick’s application.\\n\\n             Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Pulaski Circuit Court\\n\\nbecause it erroneously found Farwick’s crimes to be ineligible for expungement.\\n\\nAs Farwick is legally eligible, we thus remand the case to the Trial Court for a\\n\\ndetermination on the merits of the application as to whether to grant or deny his\\n\\nmotion for expungement.\\n\\n\\n             ALL CONCUR.\\n\\n\\n\\nBRIEF FOR APPELLANT:                      BRIEF FOR APPELLEE:\\n\\nEvan B.

Jun. 29, 2023).\\n\\n             Although subsection (1)(b) still requires a showing of “a series of\\n\\nClass D felony violations . . . arising from a single incident[,]” Farwick notes that\\n\\nsubsection (1)(d) now allows expungement of “multiple felony offenses eligible\\n\\nunder this paragraph[.]” Thus, he argues that the plain language of the amended\\n\\nstatute permits expungement of his multiple Class D felony convictions. And\\n\\n\\n                                          -5-\\n\\x0cbecause the General Assembly designated that the changes in the expungement\\n\\nstatute were to be retroactive pursuant to KRS 431.073(12), he argues that the Trial\\n\\nCourt clearly erred by concluding that his felony offenses were not eligible for\\n\\nexpungement.\\n\\n              In response, the Commonwealth takes the position that Farwick’s\\n\\nexpungement claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Farwick filed his\\n\\nsecond application for expungement on August 25, 2023. Even though the 2023\\n\\namendment to KRS 431.073(1)(d) was already in effect, Farwick did not raise it in\\n\\nthat application. Rather, he only sought expungement based upon KRS\\n\\n431.073(1)(b) – the ground on which his application had already been denied. The\\n\\nCommonwealth maintains that the principles behind res judicata required him to\\n\\nraise all possible grounds at that time, and as a result his subsequent application\\n\\nwas barred.\\n\\n              The doctrine of res judicata provides that an existing final judgment\\n\\nrendered upon the merits is conclusive of causes of action and of facts or issues\\n\\nthereby litigated, as to the parties and their privies, in all other actions in the same\\n\\nor any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction.

After careful review, we\\n\\nreverse and remand.\\n\\n                                 BACKGROUND\\n\\n            These parties were previously before this Court on an appeal from the\\n\\nsame order. We dismissed that appeal as interlocutory because Father filed the\\n\\nnotice of appeal prior to the Family Court’s ruling on his Kentucky Rule of Civil\\n\\nProcedure (“CR”) 59.05 motion to alter, amend, or vacate. Taylor v. Taylor, No.\\n\\n2022-CA-0474-MR, 2023 WL 3398203 (Ky. App. May 12, 2023). On November\\n\\n1, 2023, the Family Court entered an Order denying Father’s CR 59.05 motion, and\\n\\non November 29, 2023, Father filed a second notice of appeal. Thus, the appeal of\\n\\nthe March 28, 2022, Order is now properly before this Court.\\n\\n            Because the facts at issue remain the same, we shall adopt the\\n\\nfollowing background as outlined in the Court’s previous Opinion:\\n\\n                  Father and Mother were married in 2006 and\\n            separated in 2013. [Child] was born during the marriage.\\n            On December 12, 2013, [Mother] filed a petition for\\n            dissolution of the marriage. The parties eventually\\n            entered into a marital settlement agreement, which\\n            provided, in relevant part, that they would share joint\\n            custody of Child with the parties sharing equal parenting\\n            time. The Family Court adopted their agreement into a\\n            decree entered on July 21, 2014.\\n\\n                   The current dispute arose in December 2021, when\\n            Father contacted Mother about vaccinating Child with the\\n            Pfizer-BioNTech pediatric vaccine for COVID-19.\\n            Mother opposed Child having the vaccine, stating that\\n\\n                                        -2-\\n\\x0c            there was insufficient data on its potential long-term\\n            effects. However, Mother indicated that she might be\\n            open to the idea in the future.\\n\\n                   On January 24, 2022, Father contacted Mother,\\n            again asking about having Child vaccinated. Mother\\n            again expressed concerns about the vaccine’s efficacy\\n            and potential side effects. Father stated that Child\\n            needed to be vaccinated before a planned cruise, but\\n            Mother still refused to allow it. Father then stated that he\\n            intended to get Child vaccinated anyway. Child received\\n            the first dose of the vaccine on January 28.\\n\\n                   On February 10, 2022, Mother filed a motion to\\n            show cause why Father should not be held in contempt\\n            for his failure to abide by the joint custody provisions of\\n            the settlement agreement. She also sought to prohibit\\n            Father from further vaccinating Child without her\\n            consent. The Family Court held a hearing on the motions\\n            on March 21, 2022.\\n\\n            Thereafter, on March 28, 2022, the Family Court issued\\n            findings of fact, conclusions of law, and separate orders\\n            on the motions. After summarizing the testimony, the\\n            Family Court found that it is not in the best interest of\\n            Child to be administered the remaining doses of the\\n            vaccine. In a separate order, the Court found Father in\\n            contempt for violation of the custody terms for having\\n            Child vaccinated without Mother’s agreement. The court\\n            directed that Father “shall obtain leave of the Court or\\n            [Mother’s] agreement for any and all future major life\\n            decisions pertaining to the minor child.”\\n\\nTaylor, 2023 WL 3398203, at *1.\\n\\n            Additionally, we note that after the March 21, 2022, hearing, the\\n\\nFamily Court took the matter under consideration and asked the parties’ counsel to\\n\\nsubmit proposed orders; it made no oral rulings on that date. The accompanying\\n\\n                                        -3-\\n\\x0cdocket sheet also did not include any contemporaneous, additional findings.\\n\\n(Record at 81.) In its written Order entered one week later, the Family Court stated\\n\\nthat it must determine the best interests of the Child under Kentucky Revised\\n\\nStatute (“KRS”) Chapter 403, and that it was not in Child’s best interests to receive\\n\\nfurther doses of the COVID-19 injection at that time. On appeal, Father argues\\n\\nthat the Family Court erred by not applying properly the statutory, best-interests-\\n\\nof-the-child standard under KRS 403.270 by issuing an insufficient, conclusory\\n\\norder.\\n\\n                                    ANALYSIS\\n\\n             As an initial matter, we must address Mother’s failure to file a\\n\\nresponsive brief. Kentucky Rule of Appellate Procedure (“RAP”) 31(H)(3)\\n\\nprovides sanctions for this type of neglect:\\n\\n             If the appellee’s brief has not been filed within the time\\n             allowed, the court may: (a) accept the appellant’s\\n             statement of the facts and issues as correct; (b) reverse\\n             the judgment if appellant’s brief reasonably appears to\\n             sustain such action; or (c) regard the appellee’s failure as\\n             a confession of error and reverse the judgment without\\n             considering the merits of the case.\\n\\nThe decision whether to impose any of these penalties is within our discretion.\\n\\nRoberts v. Bucci, 218 S.W.3d 395, 396 (Ky. App. 2007).\\n\\n             In this instance, we elect to reverse the judgment for two reasons.\\n\\nFirst, Father’s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action pursuant to RAP\\n\\n\\n                                         -4-\\n\\x0c31(H)(3). Specifically, Father’s brief and the record support his argument that the\\n\\nFamily Court did not adequately consider factors related to Child’s best interests as\\n\\nmandated by KRS 403.270. But because this issue addresses the actual merits, we\\n\\ndo so as well despite Mother’s failures, and we hold that the Family Court’s Order\\n\\nwas insufficient as a matter of law as it did not address the best-interest-of-the-\\n\\nchild standard.\\n\\n             A Trial Court has a good faith duty to reduce its findings to writing,\\n\\nwhich is especially important in child custody cases as “matters affecting the\\n\\nwelfare and future of children are among the most important duties undertaken by\\n\\nthe courts of this Commonwealth.” Keifer v. Keifer, 354 S.W.3d 123, 125-26 (Ky.\\n\\n2011); see also CR 52.01. When joint custodians are unable to agree on a\\n\\nparenting issue regarding their child, a Family Court must resolve the issue\\n\\naccording to the child’s best interests. Burchell v. Burchell, 684 S.W.2d 296, 300\\n\\n(Ky. App. 1984); Gonzales v. Dooley, 614 S.W.3d 515, 521 (Ky. App. 2020). The\\n\\nbest-interests-of-the-child standard is found in KRS 403.270, which directs a\\n\\nFamily Court “to ‘consider all relevant factors’ and provides a non-exhaustive list\\n\\nof factors that are relevant to the best interests of the child.” Anderson v. Johnson,\\n\\n350 S.W.3d 453, 457 (Ky. 2011).\\n\\n             Proper consideration of factors is imperative because in order “[t]o\\n\\nreview the judge’s decision on appeal, it is important to know what facts the judge\\n\\n\\n                                          -5-\\n\\x0crelied on in order to determine whether [the judge] has made a mistake of fact, or\\n\\nto even determine if [the judge] is right at law, but for the wrong facts. If a judge\\n\\nmust choose between facts, it is clearly relevant which facts supported [the\\n\\njudge’s] opinion.” Id. at 455. The Courts have long recognized that the factual\\n\\nfindings required in child custody context are “complex and multi-faceted.” See\\n\\nSmith v. McCoy, 635 S.W.3d 811, 817 (Ky. 2021). “In the child custody context,\\n\\nthe mere written finding that something is or is not in a child’s best interest cannot\\n\\nbe sufficient because it does not show how the trial court weighed each factor to\\n\\ndetermine what was in the child’s best interest.” Id.\\n\\n             This Court has previously examined a dispute between joint\\n\\ncustodians concerning the administration of the COVID-19 injection to their\\n\\nchildren. Burch v. Lipscomb, 638 S.W.3d 460 (Ky. App. 2021). In Burch, the\\n\\nunderlying Court “found that it would be in the children’s best interest to be\\n\\nvaccinated in accordance with their pediatrician’s recommendations and Centers\\n\\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.” Id. at 464. In ruling on the\\n\\nissue, this Court noted that the lower Court provided explicit reasons for its\\n\\ndecision “that, on balance, the children’s health and welfare outweighed the\\n\\nreligious beliefs of one parent.” Id.\\n\\n             Unlike Burch, in which the Family Court clearly considered factors\\n\\nfrom KRS 403.270(2) and engaged in a multi-faceted balancing of those factors, in\\n\\n\\n                                          -6-\\n\\x0cthe case sub judice, we cannot determine from the Order entered below if the\\n\\nFamily Court actually “considered” or engaged in a weighing of any factors\\n\\npursuant to KRS 403.270. The Family Court made the sole conclusory finding that\\n\\nit would not be in Child’s best interests to receive further doses of the COVID-19\\n\\ninjection and ordered that Father shall be prohibited from taking Child to receive\\n\\nsuch injections in the future. The rest of the Family Court’s findings consist of a\\n\\nsimple summary of the testimony of each witness. This detailed testimony would\\n\\nsupport specific conclusions of law sufficient to grant or deny the motion, but the\\n\\nFamily Court made none.\\n\\n             Notably, while the Order mentions KRS Chapter 403, it neither\\n\\nspecifically cites KRS 403.270 nor any of its factors. Furthermore, the Family\\n\\nCourt’s Order does not provide any reasoning to support its finding of best\\n\\ninterests, identify which testimony or any factors it relied upon when considering\\n\\nKRS 403.270, or explain “why” the Family Court chose to give more weight to\\n\\none witness’s testimony over another’s. See Childress v. Hart, 592 S.W.3d 314,\\n\\n318 (Ky. App. 2019). The Family Court may adopt findings provided by the\\n\\nparties, but a Court’s findings must include adequate reasoning to make its\\n\\nconclusions of law. Thus, Father’s brief alone, with no Appellee brief in response\\n\\nby Mother, gives sufficient reason to sustain reversal. And because the Family\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -7-\\n\\x0cCourt’s Order does not contain any reasoning at all to support its conclusion, we\\n\\nmust reverse.\\n\\n             Before concluding, we are compelled to note that it has not escaped us\\n\\nthat one reason for Mother’s failure to respond is that this matter may be moot.\\n\\nThe main reason proffered for the COVID-19 injection was an imminent vacation\\n\\ncruise, and the urgency of that time period has long ended. Moreover, it has now\\n\\nbeen almost three years since the Order at issue was entered. We are in a different\\n\\nstage of COVID-19 at present.

After careful review, we\\n\\nreverse and remand.\\n\\n                                 BACKGROUND\\n\\n            These parties were previously before this Court on an appeal from the\\n\\nsame order. We dismissed that appeal as interlocutory because Father filed the\\n\\nnotice of appeal prior to the Family Court’s ruling on his Kentucky Rule of Civil\\n\\nProcedure (“CR”) 59.05 motion to alter, amend, or vacate. Taylor v. Taylor, No.\\n\\n2022-CA-0474-MR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 WL 3398203</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. App. May 12, 2023). On November\\n\\n1, 2023, the Family Court entered an Order denying Father’s CR 59.05 motion, and\\n\\non November 29, 2023, Father filed a second notice of appeal. Thus, the appeal of\\n\\nthe March 28, 2022, Order is now properly before this Court.\\n\\n            Because the facts at issue remain the same, we shall adopt the\\n\\nfollowing background as outlined in the Court’s previous Opinion:\\n\\n                  Father and Mother were married in 2006 and\\n            separated in 2013. [Child] was born during the marriage.\\n            On December 12, 2013, [Mother] filed a petition for\\n            dissolution of the marriage. The parties eventually\\n            entered into a marital settlement agreement, which\\n            provided, in relevant part, that they would share joint\\n            custody of Child with the parties sharing equal parenting\\n            time. The Family Court adopted their agreement into a\\n            decree entered on July 21, 2014.\\n\\n                   The current dispute arose in December 2021, when\\n            Father contacted Mother about vaccinating Child with the\\n            Pfizer-BioNTech pediatric vaccine for COVID-19.\\n            Mother opposed Child having the vaccine, stating that\\n\\n                                        -2-\\n\\x0c            there was insufficient data on its potential long-term\\n            effects. However, Mother indicated that she might be\\n            open to the idea in the future.\\n\\n                   On January 24, 2022, Father contacted Mother,\\n            again asking about having Child vaccinated. Mother\\n            again expressed concerns about the vaccine’s efficacy\\n            and potential side effects. Father stated that Child\\n            needed to be vaccinated before a planned cruise, but\\n            Mother still refused to allow it. Father then stated that he\\n            intended to get Child vaccinated anyway. Child received\\n            the first dose of the vaccine on January 28.\\n\\n                   On February 10, 2022, Mother filed a motion to\\n            show cause why Father should not be held in contempt\\n            for his failure to abide by the joint custody provisions of\\n            the settlement agreement. She also sought to prohibit\\n            Father from further vaccinating Child without her\\n            consent. The Family Court held a hearing on the motions\\n            on March 21, 2022.\\n\\n            Thereafter, on March 28, 2022, the Family Court issued\\n            findings of fact, conclusions of law, and separate orders\\n            on the motions. After summarizing the testimony, the\\n            Family Court found that it is not in the best interest of\\n            Child to be administered the remaining doses of the\\n            vaccine. In a separate order, the Court found Father in\\n            contempt for violation of the custody terms for having\\n            Child vaccinated without Mother’s agreement. The court\\n            directed that Father “shall obtain leave of the Court or\\n            [Mother’s] agreement for any and all future major life\\n            decisions pertaining to the minor child.”\\n\\nTaylor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2023 WL 3398203</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1.\\n\\n            Additionally, we note that after the March 21, 2022, hearing, the\\n\\nFamily Court took the matter under consideration and asked the parties’ counsel to\\n\\nsubmit proposed orders; it made no oral rulings on that date. The accompanying\\n\\n                                        -3-\\n\\x0cdocket sheet also did not include any contemporaneous, additional findings.\\n\\n(Record at 81.) In its written Order entered one week later, the Family Court stated\\n\\nthat it must determine the best interests of the Child under Kentucky Revised\\n\\nStatute (“KRS”) Chapter 403, and that it was not in Child’s best interests to receive\\n\\nfurther doses of the COVID-19 injection at that time. On appeal, Father argues\\n\\nthat the Family Court erred by not applying properly the statutory, best-interests-\\n\\nof-the-child standard under KRS 403.270 by issuing an insufficient, conclusory\\n\\norder.\\n\\n                                    ANALYSIS\\n\\n             As an initial matter, we must address Mother’s failure to file a\\n\\nresponsive brief. Kentucky Rule of Appellate Procedure (“RAP”) 31(H)(3)\\n\\nprovides sanctions for this type of neglect:\\n\\n             If the appellee’s brief has not been filed within the time\\n             allowed, the court may: (a) accept the appellant’s\\n             statement of the facts and issues as correct; (b) reverse\\n             the judgment if appellant’s brief reasonably appears to\\n             sustain such action; or (c) regard the appellee’s failure as\\n             a confession of error and reverse the judgment without\\n             considering the merits of the case.\\n\\nThe decision whether to impose any of these penalties is within our discretion.\\n\\nRoberts v.

App. 2007).\\n\\n             In this instance, we elect to reverse the judgment for two reasons.\\n\\nFirst, Father’s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action pursuant to RAP\\n\\n\\n                                         -4-\\n\\x0c31(H)(3). Specifically, Father’s brief and the record support his argument that the\\n\\nFamily Court did not adequately consider factors related to Child’s best interests as\\n\\nmandated by KRS 403.270. But because this issue addresses the actual merits, we\\n\\ndo so as well despite Mother’s failures, and we hold that the Family Court’s Order\\n\\nwas insufficient as a matter of law as it did not address the best-interest-of-the-\\n\\nchild standard.\\n\\n             A Trial Court has a good faith duty to reduce its findings to writing,\\n\\nwhich is especially important in child custody cases as “matters affecting the\\n\\nwelfare and future of children are among the most important duties undertaken by\\n\\nthe courts of this Commonwealth.” Keifer v.

Langley (“Langley”) was\\n\\nconvicted by Henderson Circuit Court of first-degree robbery, possession of a\\n\\nhandgun by a convicted felon, intimidating a participant in the legal process, and\\n\\ntwo counts of first-degree wanton endangerment. He received a total sentence of\\n\\nfifteen years’ imprisonment. Langley appeals his conviction as a matter of right,\\n\\nasserting trial errors. We affirm.\\n\\x0c                                      FACTS\\n\\n             Langley was nineteen years old on August 12, 2022, when he was\\n\\narrested for possession of a handgun by a convicted felon and first-degree wanton\\n\\nendangerment. The Henderson Police Department (“HPD”) arrested Langley after\\n\\nan investigation into a shooting. Said shooting had taken place just over two\\n\\nweeks prior and about two miles away from the scene of Langley’s arrest.\\n\\n             The afternoon of July 28, 2022, around 3:15 p.m., members of HPD\\n\\nresponded to a “shots fired” dispatch at 1424 Woodland Drive in Henderson, the\\n\\naddress of Woodsview Apartments (“Woodsview”). Woodsview is an apartment\\n\\ncomplex consisting of 68 units situated on or near the southern end of Woodland\\n\\nDrive, which ends in a cul-de-sac. The manager of Woodsview would testify that\\n\\ngenerally, a little less than 200 residents are occupying the apartments at a given\\n\\ntime, with at least half of them minor children.\\n\\n             Investigators arriving at the scene found evidence of shots fired into\\n\\napartment #9. Officers who initially arrived gained access inside from Woodsview\\n\\nmanagement, cleared the apartment, and confirmed no resident there had been\\n\\nhome. During their sweep, the officers observed multiple bullet holes to the walls\\n\\nand fixtures inside. One bullet had passed through the walls into an adjoining\\n\\napartment.\\n\\n             Five shell casings, all from a .380 caliber firearm, were located,\\n\\n                                         -2-\\n\\x0cphotographed, and collected outside apartment #9. Three bullet holes visible in\\n\\napartment #9’s windows were photographed. The bullet hole into the adjacent unit\\n\\nwas documented and photographed from the stairway of apartment #10, where it\\n\\nhad entered. Also found on the same stairway was a projectile HPD determined\\n\\nwas a .380 caliber bullet. Officers took statements from witnesses on the scene,\\n\\nincluding Woodsview employees and residents.\\n\\n             Woodsview’s manager, Christine Payne (“Payne”), gave investigating\\n\\nofficers access to surveillance video recorded from the front office on Woodland\\n\\nDrive. Payne would later testify that many neighborhood children were out and\\n\\nabout that day, at and near the scene, because the shooting occurred midday during\\n\\nthe summer. Several children had immediately described to her the shooting and\\n\\nthe direction of the car the shots had been fired from. Investigating officers first\\n\\nviewed the video in the front office alongside minors who had witnessed the\\n\\nshooting. These witnesses pointed out a red Chevrolet HHR in the surveillance\\n\\nvideo as the gunfire’s source. Several distinct features of the HHR – including\\n\\nblack rims, a black grill, a spoiler, and a small white stripe – were identifiable in\\n\\nthe images. Immediate efforts to locate the HHR were unsuccessful.\\n\\n             In the days following, Det. Jake Isonhood, who led HPD’s\\n\\ninvestigation, located an image of a red HHR captured in a video taken by a Flock\\n\\ncamera (a license plate recognition system) in Evansville, Indiana. The vehicle\\n\\n                                          -3-\\n\\x0cwas recorded traveling southbound in Evansville on July 28, 2022, at 11:45 a.m.,\\n\\nroughly three-and-a-half hours prior to the shooting. Details and features of the\\n\\nvehicle matched those of the HHR in the Woodsview surveillance video.\\n\\nRetrieving license plate information, Det. Isonhood found the HHR was registered\\n\\nto Devin Druin (“Druin”) in Evansville.\\n\\n             On August 5, 2002, after tracking Druin down, Det. Isonhood\\n\\naccompanied another officer to Druin’s attorney’s office where Druin’s recorded\\n\\nstatement was taken. At that time, Druin identified Langley as the shooter in the\\n\\nincident. He also alleged Langley had stolen his wallet just after the shooting and\\n\\nhad threatened him with retaliation if Druin broke his silence.\\n\\n             Druin told investigating officers he saw the handgun Langley used\\n\\nand believed it was a .380 caliber. After his recorded statement, Druin provided\\n\\nHPD with a pencil drawing depicting his recollection of Langley’s handgun.\\n\\nAdditionally, Druin provided an account statement showing declined charges from\\n\\na company called Jp Taxi. The card associated with this account had been in\\n\\nDruin’s wallet when Langley took it, the charges had been attempted after the\\n\\nshooting, and Druin had not authorized them, according to Druin.\\n\\n             Even prior to Druin’s recorded statement, Detective Isonhood had\\n\\nreceived a tip from another source identifying the shooter as Langley. This led him\\n\\nto obtain and view a video from the Henderson County Detention Center\\n\\n                                          -4-\\n\\x0c(“HCDC”) recorded July 27, 2022, the day prior to the shooting. Depicted therein\\n\\nwas a “visit” Langley made to an HCDC inmate, by videoconference, with\\n\\nLangley calling from a remote location. The jail call video showed a split screen\\n\\nwith the HCDC inmate’s face and torso on the left side on the screen and Langley\\n\\non the right. Langley’s hair is styled in a tall Afro in the video. On multiple\\n\\noccasions during the video call, Langley moved the camera he was using from his\\n\\nown face and pointed it toward different parts of the room he was in. For a couple\\n\\nof moments, during these points, what appears to be a handgun on top of a piece of\\n\\nfurniture comes into Langley’s camera’s view.\\n\\n             The jail video call begins with Langley and the inmate exchanging\\n\\ngreetings, after which the inmate asks, “where you at?” and Langley responds,\\n\\n“I’m at my spot . . . my crib.” After this, the inmate asks Langley for a “house\\n\\ntour” and Langley briefly moves his camera to pan around the room. At one point,\\n\\nthe inmate asks Langley who the person in the room with him is and Langley\\n\\nresponds, “that’s my girl.” At the inmate’s request, Langley points the camera\\n\\ntoward a bed beside him and a young woman can briefly be seen.\\n\\n             After he was located and arrested by HPD, Langley was eventually\\n\\nindicted for first-degree robbery, possession of a handgun by a felon, first-degree\\n\\nwanton endangerment, and intimidating a participant in a legal process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -5-\\n\\x0c                 A trial took place on May 25, 2023, in a bifurcated guilt-phase\\n\\nproceeding; the jury was not asked to consider the felon in possession of a handgun\\n\\ncharges initially. The errors alleged by Langley as the basis for his appeal\\n\\noccurred during the initial guilt phase. Langley did not testify, and the defense put\\n\\non no proof after the Commonwealth rested. The Commonwealth called numerous\\n\\nwitnesses including employees of Woodsview and several officers from HPD who\\n\\nresponded to the dispatch.\\n\\nTrial Testimony of Woodsview Residents\\n\\n                 Adam Clark (“Clark”), who lived in apartment #10, described how he\\n\\nand his wife Marion were at home napping when they were awakened by the\\n\\ngunfire. Clark said he had found the bullet hole in his stairway through a wall\\n\\nadjacent to apartment #9 just after he awoke to the gunfire. Although Clark and\\n\\nhis wife were home alone at the time, Clark said their young son often played on\\n\\nthe stairway when the couple’s children were home.\\n\\n                 Two young men who resided in Woodsview, Eric Ponder and S.M.,1\\n\\ntestified. Both had given statements to HPD on the day of the shooting. Neither\\n\\nsaw the shots being fired, both heard the shots, then observed a red SUV-type\\n\\nvehicle fleeing. Both saw a white male in the driver’s seat and a black male in the\\n\\npassenger seat. Ponder, who was walking back to Woodsview after playing\\n\\n\\n1\\n    Names of witnesses who were minors at the time of the trial are indicated by initials.\\n                                                  -6-\\n\\x0cbasketball when he heard the shots, described seeing a “silverish” gun held by the\\n\\nblack male. On cross-examination, he described his line of vision on the gun as\\n\\nbeing through the vehicle’s windshield. S.M. described running from his\\n\\napartment after hearing the shots and seeing the red SUV. He described being able\\n\\nto see that the black male was holding a “small silver pistol.” S.M. said the black\\n\\nmale was wearing a hoodie and described his hair as “an Afro.”\\n\\nTrial Testimony of Det. Jake Isonhood\\n\\n              Det. Isonhood was the final member of HPD to testify during the\\n\\ninitial guilt phase. He described the investigation and his own efforts to locate the\\n\\nred HHR, and then Druin. The recorded statement Druin gave was briefly\\n\\ndiscussed. At that point in the investigation, Det. Isonhood believed Langley’s jail\\n\\ncall video had been made from a house at 131 Clay Street in Henderson, and he\\n\\ntook a photo of the house to Druin’s recorded statement. Det. Isonhood described\\n\\nthe investigation, including his taking a statement from Melissa Easley, who\\n\\nresided at 131 Clay Street, on August 15, 2022. Additionally, he took statements\\n\\nat Henderson County schools, on August 24th and 25th of 2022 from H.N.2 and\\n\\nM.E., both minors who resided at 131 Clay Street. In response to an inquiry about\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  H.N. was named as a witness by the Commonwealth and was even mentioned in opening\\nstatements. However, for reasons which do not appear in the record before us, she did not\\ntestify.\\n                                              -7-\\n\\x0cH.N., Det. Isonhood stated she was the person in the room with Langley on the jail\\n\\ncall video.\\n\\n              The detective went on to describe his questioning Langley on August\\n\\n12, 2022. He began with asking Langley where he was currently staying and\\n\\nLangley asserted he had no fixed address. Det. Isonhood asked Langley if he had\\n\\never hung around at 131 Clay Street or known anyone there and he described\\n\\nLangley saying he “promised” he had not. After Det. Isonhood showed him a\\n\\nphotograph of the house, Langley admitted to having been there but not within a\\n\\ncouple of months. After being confronted with further information about Easley,\\n\\nLangley admitted he had stayed there but had already moved out before the time of\\n\\nthe shooting.\\n\\n              Det. Isonhood described showing Langley a photo of Druin’s HHR\\n\\nfrom the Flock video and telling him the vehicle’s owner identified him as the\\n\\nshooter. Langley told him he “did not shoot a gun.” At that point, Det. Isonhood\\n\\nsaid he “brought up the jail video visit” and described to Langley that when his\\n\\n“camera pans – there is a gun there.” Det. Isonhood said Langley told him he\\n\\ndidn’t have a gun, so he “went over the visit again” and said to Langley “you’re\\n\\nstanding here and there’s a door behind you and a closet behind you and there’s a\\n\\nbed right here. You pan and there’s a gun. And [Langley’s] response was, well\\n\\nthat’s not mine though.” As he described pressing Langley further, Det. Isonhood\\n\\n                                        -8-\\n\\x0csaid he “did not deny existence” of a gun in the room with him, he “just denied\\n\\nownership.”\\n\\nTrial Testimony of Devin Druin\\n\\n              Druin was twenty years old when he testified at Langley’s trial. On\\n\\nJuly 28, 2022, Druin had driven from Evansville to 131 Clay Street in Henderson,\\n\\nplanning to smoke marijuana with a female acquaintance. After arriving there,\\n\\nDruin was introduced to Langley, who told him he was “cousins with” Druin’s\\n\\nolder brother. Druin testified this prompted him to phone his older brother, who\\n\\nconfirmed Langley was his cousin. Following this, the pair, along with several\\n\\nfemales, smoked marijuana and talked for a period. Eventually, Langley told\\n\\nDruin he wanted to go to see his daughter and asked for a ride to do this. Druin,\\n\\ndespite having only just met Langley, thought he “seemed like a nice person” and\\n\\nso he agreed. Following Langley’s directions, he drove until they arrived at\\n\\nWoodsview, where he circled two or three times at Langley’s request, before being\\n\\ndirected to stop.\\n\\n              As he came to a stop, Druin recalled, his sight was focused upon “kids\\n\\nin the middle of the road.” Immediately upon reaching a full stop, he heard gunfire\\n\\nand believed they were being shot at, which caused him to speed off in a panic.\\n\\nWhile making his first turn onto the “main road,” Druin explained, he looked over\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -9-\\n\\x0cto see that Langley was okay. At that time, he saw Langley had a gun in his right\\n\\nhand.\\n\\n             Druin testified smoke was still coming from the barrel when he first\\n\\nlaid eyes on the gun. Druin said he was familiar with guns and believed the gun he\\n\\nsaw in Langley’s hand was a .380. He said he only saw the top of the gun and it\\n\\nwas “silver,” later describing it as having a “silver slide.” In the drawing Druin\\n\\nprovided, he had drawn grooves at the top of the gun.\\n\\n             Upon seeing the gun, Druin yelled, “what the f--- bro!?!” to which\\n\\nLangley commanded he “shut up and keep driving.” Druin complied and drove\\n\\nLangley to a directed location. As Druin stopped for Langley to get out, Langley\\n\\ndisplayed Druin’s wallet he had taken from an open center compartment, saying to\\n\\nDruin, “if you tell anybody, I know where you live.” Druin affirmed on redirect he\\n\\nhad felt intimidated by Langley at this time.\\n\\n             After he left Langley, Druin immediately called his father, who told\\n\\nhim to go home. Druin said he did not call the police because of fear for his\\n\\nyounger sister. Asked to explain, Druin said he did not live at the address which\\n\\nwould be found in his wallet; that address referred to his mother’s house, where his\\n\\nsister lived. He did not want “to put her in harm’s way.” When asked to explain\\n\\nthis further, Druin alluded to his own older brother associating with a group he\\n\\navoided as they were violent.\\n\\n                                        -10-\\n\\x0c             For the next few days, Druin tried to put the incident out of his mind\\n\\nand act as though nothing happened. This came to an end when he received a\\n\\nmessage from his father that his vehicle had “been on the news” in connection with\\n\\na shooting. Druin, along with his mother, took steps to contact HPD and arranged\\n\\nto give an interview. This was soon rescheduled to a short time later, after his\\n\\nconsulting with an attorney.\\n\\nTestimony of Melissa Easley\\n\\n             Melissa Easley was the final witness to testify in the initial guilt\\n\\nphase. Easley testified she knew Langley as a friend of her kids who was staying\\n\\nin her home, on 131 Clay Street, in July 2022. Easley had let Langley move in\\n\\nbecause he “needed a place to go.” She “threw him out” after finding him “in bed\\n\\nwith a sixteen-year-old girl” and deciding he was “too friendly with the kids.”\\n\\nEasley’s daughter, M.E., and H.N. were both living with her at this time. Easley’s\\n\\nboyfriend, Stevie Davis, was also living there. Davis, Easley confirmed, was\\n\\nemployed by Jp Taxi in July of 2022.\\n\\n             Asked about Druin, Easley described an occasion she encountered\\n\\nhim in her home and “kicked him out.” She described “throwing out” both Druin\\n\\nand Langley at this time. Upon careful review of her testimony, Easley appears to\\n\\ndescribe this as part of the same event for which she evicted Langley. Both parties\\n\\nseemed to question Easley under an initial presumption that the encounter she\\n\\n                                         -11-\\n\\x0cdescribed occurred the same day as the shooting. However, Easley indicated she\\n\\nknew nothing of the shooting at the time and could not say this encounter occurred\\n\\nthe same day. Easley did recall her encounter with Druin occurred upon her arrival\\n\\nhome from work.\\n\\n             On cross-examination, Easley said she had worked different shifts\\n\\nduring this period but believed her shift, on the day she encountered Druin, would\\n\\nhave put her arrival home sometime between 6 and 7 p.m. Immediately afterward,\\n\\nshe agreed to the defense’s estimate of 4 to 6 p.m. On redirect, she conceded she\\n\\nmay have been working a different shift altogether and could have arrived home\\n\\nsignificantly earlier in the day (and prior to the time of the shooting). Near the\\n\\nclose of her testimony, Easley made clear she could not commit to her encounter\\n\\nwith Druin even taking place the same date as the Woodsview shooting. She put it\\n\\nclose in time but said it could have well been another day entirely.\\n\\n             Easley said she found a wallet in her basement that she knew was\\n\\nDruin’s because his I.D. was in it. Easley’s daughter and boyfriend both made\\n\\ncalls to Druin in efforts to get his wallet back to him, she said, but Druin never\\n\\ncame to retrieve it. Easley was unsure about the length of time after her encounter\\n\\nwith Druin before she found his wallet. She described it being “right after” at one\\n\\npoint and “maybe a day or two” later, at another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -12-\\n\\x0c             Shown a still image from the jail video call, Easley confirmed the\\n\\nroom Langley was in looked like an upstairs bedroom of 131 Clay Street.\\n\\nExamining another still image from the jail video call, with the person in the bed\\n\\nbeside Langley visible, Easley testified it “could be my daughter or maybe [H.N.].”\\n\\n             In closing arguments, Langley, by counsel, argued the shooter was, in\\n\\nfact, Druin. Easley’s testimony established Druin had returned to 131 Clay Street\\n\\nafter the shooting and demonstrated no fear of Langley. Furthermore, Langley\\n\\nargued, Easley’s account showed Langley had not taken Druin’s wallet; Druin\\n\\nsimply left it behind. He argued the testimony of Eric Ponder, who said he could\\n\\nsee the gun through the HHR’s windshield, was more consistent with the gun\\n\\nhaving been in Druin’s hand, rather than in Langley’s. The “gun” seen near\\n\\nLangley in the jail video call, he argued, could as well have been an air pistol.\\n\\nLangley asserted the gun in the video appeared smooth on top, was not shiny, and\\n\\nwas darker in color than witness descriptions of the gun used in the Woodsview\\n\\nshooting.\\n\\n             Despite Langley’s arguments, the jury found him guilty of first-degree\\n\\nrobbery, first-degree wanton endangerment (two counts), intimidating a participant\\n\\nin the legal process, and possession of a handgun by a convicted felon. The jury\\n\\nrecommended a total sentence of fifteen (15) years in prison, and the trial court\\n\\nsentenced Langley consistently with this recommendation. Langley appeals from\\n\\n                                         -13-\\n\\x0chis conviction and sentence. Further facts will be developed as necessary.\\n\\n                                       ANALYSIS\\n\\n                We begin our review on the instances of preserved error, first with the\\n\\ndenial of Langley’s motion for a directed verdict.\\n\\n                                   I. Directed Verdict\\n\\n                At the close of the Commonwealth’s proof, defense made a motion for\\n\\na directed verdict of acquittal on the charge of first-degree robbery. Langley\\n\\nalleges the trial court’s denial of this motion was reversible error.\\n\\n                For our standard of review, “the test of a directed verdict is, if under\\n\\nthe evidence as a whole, it would be clearly unreasonable for a jury to find guilt,\\n\\nonly then the defendant is entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal.”\\n\\nCommonwealth v. Benham, 816 S.W.2d 186, 187 (Ky. 1991).\\n\\n                KRS3 515.020(1) defines the elements of first-degree robbery:\\n\\n                A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in\\n                the course of committing theft, he or she uses or threatens\\n                the immediate use of physical force upon another person\\n                with intent to accomplish the theft and when he or she:\\n\\n                  (a) Causes physical injury to any person who is not a\\n                participant in the crime; or\\n\\n                   (b) Is armed with a deadly weapon; or\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n    Kentucky Revised Statutes.\\n                                            -14-\\n\\x0c               (c) Uses or threatens the immediate use of a dangerous\\n             instrument upon any person who is not a participant in\\n             the crime.\\n\\n             The trial court’s instruction on the first-degree robbery charge\\n\\nrequired the jury to find:\\n\\n             A. That in this county on or about July 28, 2022,\\n             [Langley] stole a wallet from Devin Druin,\\n\\n             B. That in the course of so doing and with intent to\\n             accomplish the theft, he used or threatened the immediate\\n             use of physical force upon Devin Druin;\\n\\n             C. That when he did so he was armed with a gun\\n\\n             And\\n\\n             D. That the gun was a deadly weapon[.]\\n\\n             Langley argues there was insufficient evidence to support the jury’s\\n\\nfinding of guilt. In particular, he argues the Commonwealth failed to prove he\\n\\nthreatened the immediate use of physical force upon Druin to accomplish the theft\\n\\nof his wallet.\\n\\n             Langley points out Druin’s testimony was the substantive basis of the\\n\\nfirst-degree robbery charge. Per Druin’s allegations, Langley did not point the gun\\n\\nat him when he took his wallet. Druin conceded Langley made no specific\\n\\nreferences to having a gun. Furthermore, Druin conceded Langley made no\\n\\nexplicit threat of immediate harm when taking the wallet, only saying, “if you tell\\n\\nanyone, I know where you live.”\\n                                        -15-\\n\\x0c              Robbery in the first degree, as defined in KRS 515.020(1), is an\\n\\naggravated form of robbery, containing all of the elements of robbery in the second\\n\\ndegree,4 with the addition of one of three possible aggravating factors. The jury in\\n\\nLangley’s trial was instructed under KRS 515.020(1)(b), requiring a finding only\\n\\nthat Langley was armed with a deadly weapon, during a theft, which he\\n\\naccomplished by threat of immediate physical force. The Commonwealth was not\\n\\nrequired to prove that Langley threatened Druin with the handgun in his\\n\\npossession, but only that Langley threatened the use of immediate physical force.\\n\\n              Langley acknowledges the statement Druin described that “if you tell\\n\\nanybody, I know where you live” might be reasonably interpreted by the jury as “a\\n\\nveiled, conditional, future threat of some harm if Druin told anyone about the\\n\\nincident.” (Emphasis added.) Langley argues this threat of future harm was the\\n\\nonly one in evidence and it was insufficient for the jury to find a threat of\\n\\nimmediate physical force.\\n\\n              Such an argument implies Druin’s testimony described, at most, a\\n\\ntheft accomplished solely by a threat of physical force in the future – extortion\\n\\nrather than robbery. However, the Commonwealth argued at trial it was\\n\\nunnecessary for Langley to brandish the firearm, or explicitly reference it, to\\n\\n\\n4\\n KRS 515.030(1) defines robbery in the second degree: “A person is guilty of robbery in the\\nsecond degree when, in the course of committing theft, he or she uses or threatens the immediate\\nuse of physical force upon another person with intent to accomplish the theft.”\\n                                             -16-\\n\\x0cestablish he used a threat of force to accomplish the theft. Evidence supported a\\n\\nfinding that Langley’s threat of immediate physical force was conveyed implicitly,\\n\\nrather than explicitly voiced. Druin’s testimony indicated he knew Langley was in\\n\\npossession of a firearm that, very shortly beforehand, he had fired into an\\n\\napartment in a densely populated area, and that Druin had felt intimidated by\\n\\nLangley when Langley took Druin’s wallet.\\n\\n              Confronted with a motion for directed verdict, the trial court must\\n\\nassume the truth of the Commonwealth’s evidence and “draw all fair and\\n\\nreasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the Commonwealth.”\\n\\nCommonwealth v. Benham, 816 S.W.2d 186, 187 (Ky. 1991). Questions regarding\\n\\nthe weight of the evidence and credibility of witnesses are reserved for the jury.\\n\\nId.\\n\\n              Langley requested, and received, an instruction on a lesser charge of\\n\\ntheft by unlawful taking. The jury, however, was apparently not convinced that the\\n\\nCommonwealth failed to prove the element of a threat of immediate physical force.\\n\\n“To sustain a conviction for robbery, all of the elements of theft or attempted theft\\n\\nmust be proved plus the additional element that in the course of committing theft\\n\\nthe use or the threat of immediate use of physical force upon another person with\\n\\nintent to accomplish the theft.” Morgan v. Commonwealth, 730 S.W.2d 935, 937\\n\\n(Ky. 1987).\\n\\n                                         -17-\\n\\x0c              The threat of physical force need not be explicit; a threat of physical\\n\\nforce which is implied from a defendant’s conduct may be sufficient for a robbery\\n\\nconviction. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 399 S.W.3d 795, 797 (Ky. App. 2013)\\n\\n(citing Tunstull v. Commonwealth, 337 S.W.3d 576 (Ky. 2011); Birdsong v.\\n\\nCommonwealth, 347 S.W.3d 47 (Ky. 2011)).5 The firing of a handgun, multiple\\n\\ntimes toward a densely populated area, then commanding to be driven to a directed\\n\\nlocation, just before brazenly taking another individual’s wallet, is implicitly\\n\\nthreatening behavior, in and of itself. See Tunstull, 337 S.W.3d at 583 (citing\\n\\nLawless v. Commonwealth, 323 S.W.3d 676 (Ky. 2010)). Druin testified to\\n\\nobeying Langley’s commands from the shooting throughout the remainder of his\\n\\nencounter with him and said, “he had a gun, and I didn’t, so there wasn’t much I\\n\\ncould do.” He affirmed he had felt intimidated at the time Druin took his wallet.\\n\\nA reasonable juror could certainly have found from Druin’s testimony describing\\n\\nLangley’s behavior, an implicit and immediate threat that physical force would\\n\\nhave followed if Druin had resisted Langley’s taking Druin’s wallet.\\n\\n              Langley’s brief emphasizes conflicts between Druin’s and Easley’s\\n\\ntestimony. It is true that, in several aspects, their accounts were at odds. However,\\n\\nthe jury’s determinations of weight and credibility in this regard are beyond the\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  Lewis concerned a directed verdict denial on second-degree robbery but on the same element of\\nrobbery as at issue here.\\n                                             -18-\\n\\x0cscope of our review. See Beaumont v. Commonwealth, 295 S.W.3d 60, 67 (Ky.\\n\\n2009). We discern no reversible error in the trial court’s denial of Langley’s\\n\\nmotion for a directed verdict for first-degree robbery under the applicable standard\\n\\nof review. The jury’s finding of guilt was not unreasonable given the evidence as a\\n\\nwhole. See Benham, 816 S.W.2d at 187. We affirm the trial court’s denial of\\n\\ndirected verdict on this count.\\n\\n                                    II.   KRE6 404\\n\\n                Moving to the other preserved allegation of error, Langley alleges the\\n\\ntrial court erred in denying his motion to exclude the jail call video. When\\n\\nreviewing a trial court’s evidentiary rulings, our standard of review is abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion. “The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial judge’s decision\\n\\nwas arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles.”\\n\\nCommonwealth v. English, 993 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Ky. 1999).\\n\\n               The Commonwealth filed formal notices of its intention to introduce\\n\\nevidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts pursuant to KRE 404(c) and argued the\\n\\nvideo would be presented as proof of the opportunity to possess the handgun in\\n\\nthe video. A supplemental notice indicated Druin would testify about the\\n\\ndescription of a handgun consistent with that depicted in the jail call video. The\\n\\nCommonwealth argued the video’s introduction would be for corroboration of\\n\\n\\n6\\n    Kentucky Rules of Evidence.\\n                                          -19-\\n\\x0cDruin’s testimony, rather than Langley’s propensity to violence. Langley filed no\\n\\nwritten responses. During a pretrial conference, the court heard argument from\\n\\nboth parties. The trial court reserved its ruling until the morning of trial, when\\n\\nthe court ordered the jail video call could be admitted. Langley renewed his\\n\\nobjection on the record.\\n\\n            At trial, the video was initially introduced during the testimony of\\n\\nMajor William Payne of HCDC, who authenticated it being an HCDC video call\\n\\ntaking place July 27, 2022, shortly after 6:00 p.m. Major Payne verified the inmate\\n\\ndepicted was incarcerated at HCDC on that date. About a minute and a half of the\\n\\njail video call was played. Later, the video was played during the testimony of\\n\\nDetective Isonhood.\\n\\n            KRE 404(b) dictates that “evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\\n\\nis not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in\\n\\nconformity therewith.” Such evidence may be admissible when it is “offered for\\n\\nsome other purpose, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\\n\\nplan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident[.]” KRE 404(b)(1).\\n\\nSuch evidence may also be admissible where it is “so inextricably intertwined\\n\\nwith other evidence essential to the case that separation of the two (2) could not\\n\\nbe accomplished without serious adverse effect on the offering party.” KRE\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        -20-\\n\\x0c404(b)(2). KRE 404(b) is exclusionary in nature. Bell v. Commonwealth, 875\\n\\nS.W.2d 882, 889 (Ky. 1994).\\n\\n            To determine whether 404(b) evidence is admissible, a trial court is\\n\\nto use a three-prong test: “(1) Is the evidence relevant? (2) Does it have\\n\\nprobative value? (3) Is its probative value substantially outweighed by its\\n\\nprejudicial effect?” Leach v. Commonwealth, 571 S.W.3d 550, 554 (Ky. 2019)\\n\\n(citing Purcell v. Commonwealth, 149 S.W.3d 382, 399-400 (Ky. 2004),\\n\\noverruled on other grounds by Commonwealth v. Prater, 324 S.W.3d 393, 399-\\n\\n400 (Ky. 2010)).\\n\\n            “The first prong of the test is whether the proffered evidence is\\n\\nrelevant for a purpose other than criminal disposition.” Leach, 571 S.W.3d at\\n\\n554. Acceptable purposes of other bad act evidence include “proof of motive,\\n\\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake\\n\\nor accident[.]” KRE 404(b)(1). The statutory list is not exhaustive but\\n\\nillustrative. Tamme v. Commonwealth, 973 S.W.2d 13, 29 (Ky. 1998). The\\n\\nevidence must be offered to prove material facts which are actually disputed.\\n\\nLeach, 571 S.W.3d at 554.\\n\\n            For the second prong, “the trial court must determine if the evidence\\n\\nof the uncharged crime is sufficiently probative of its commission by the accused\\n\\nto warrant its introduction into evidence.” Id. This standard is met if the trial\\n\\n                                        -21-\\n\\x0cjudge believes “the jury could reasonably infer that the prior bad acts occurred\\n\\nand that [the defendant] committed such acts.” Parker v. Commonwealth, 952\\n\\nS.W.2d 209, 214 (Ky. 1997).\\n\\n             For the third prong, “the trial court must weigh the prejudicial nature\\n\\nof the ‘other bad acts’ evidence versus its probative value. Only if the potential\\n\\nfor undue prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence\\n\\nmust it be excluded.” Leach, 571 S.W.3d at 554.\\n\\n            Langley argues no connection between the item in the video and the\\n\\ngun used in the offenses was established; nothing tied the “gun” in the video to\\n\\nthe gun used in the crime. Accordingly, he argues, the evidence was not relevant\\n\\nand could not serve the purpose of proving Langley’s opportunity to access a gun.\\n\\n            The Commonwealth argued to the trial court that the firearm pictured\\n\\nin the video call resembled the firearm described and drawn by Druin, and that\\n\\nthe jail call video was recorded less than 24 hours before the shooting. HPD was\\n\\nunable to locate the firearm used in the shooting and the video was substantive\\n\\nevidence that Langley had access to a handgun and the opportunity to possess one\\n\\nthe day prior to the shooting. The jail call video depicted Langley’s appearance,\\n\\nless than 24 hours before the shooting, and showed he was at 131 Clay Street. It\\n\\nprovided context of the HPD investigation, corroborated testimony regarding\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        -22-\\n\\x0cwhere Langley resided at the time, and established his having access to the house\\n\\nwhere Druin’s wallet was later found.\\n\\n            Langley insists the evidence of the gun was not probative for the\\n\\nsame reasons as he argued it was not relevant, that no connection was made\\n\\nbetween the gun in the video and the gun used in the crime. However, Druin\\n\\ntestified the handgun had a “silver slide,” the eyewitnesses to Druin and Langley\\n\\nfleeing described the gun as “silverish” and a “small silver pistol.” The\\n\\nCommonwealth argued the gun shown on the video resembled these descriptions\\n\\nand Druin’s drawing. Langley’s arguments about the gun’s appearance greatly\\n\\ndiffering from Druin’s description and drawing were presented to the jury.\\n\\n            Having viewed the jail video call, we conclude a jury could\\n\\nreasonably infer the handgun in the video matched the descriptions of the gun\\n\\nused in the shooting and that the video demonstrated Langley’s access to it. It is\\n\\nclear the evidence was sufficiently probative to warrant its introduction into\\n\\nevidence under standards discussed in Leach, 571 S.W.3d at 554.\\n\\n            Finally, this evidence was not unduly prejudicial, and its potential for\\n\\nprejudice did not substantially outweigh its probative value. Evidence is only\\n\\nunduly prejudicial if it “produces an emotional response that inflames the passions\\n\\nof the triers of fact or is used for an improper purpose.” Id. (citation omitted). No\\n\\nsuch prejudice arises from the mere possession of a firearm, which by itself is not\\n\\n                                        -23-\\n\\x0ca crime or proof of a violent character. McQueen v. Commonwealth, 339 S.W.3d\\n\\n441, 448 (Ky. 2011).\\n\\n             The trial court did not issue any findings as to why it allowed\\n\\nintroduction of the jail video call, but there was a legally sufficient basis for it to\\n\\nallow introduction of the video based on applicable law and the record before us.\\n\\nThere is no indication the trial court’s decision was arbitrary, unreasonable,\\n\\nunfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles. In sum, the trial court did not\\n\\nabuse its discretion in allowing the jail call video into evidence despite Langley’s\\n\\nKRE 404(b) argument.\\n\\n                              III. Unpreserved Errors\\n\\n             Langley makes two arguments regarding the jail call video which\\n\\nwere not specifically preserved. One concerns the audio portion of the recording\\n\\nand the other concerns Det. Isonhood’s testimony.\\n\\n             For errors not preserved for our review, the standard of review is the\\n\\nsame: only when manifest injustice occurs may palpable error be found, and an\\n\\nunpreserved error reversed.\\n\\n             For an error to be palpable, it must be easily perceptible,\\n             plain, obvious and readily noticeable.\\n\\n             A palpable error must involve prejudice more egregious\\n             than that occurring in reversible error. A palpable error\\n             must be so grave in nature that if it were uncorrected, it\\n             would seriously affect the fairness of the proceedings.\\n\\n                                          -24-\\n\\x0c             Thus, what a palpable error analysis boils down to is\\n             whether the reviewing court believes there is a\\n             substantial possibility that the result in the case would\\n             have been different without the error. If not, the error\\n             cannot be palpable.\\n\\nBrewer v. Commonwealth, 206 S.W.3d 343, 349 (Ky. 2006) (internal quotation\\n\\nmarks and citations omitted).\\n\\n1. Audio on the Jail Call\\n\\n             Langley argues the trial court should have removed the audio from the\\n\\njail call video because the audio was unduly prejudicial. Langley points only to a\\n\\nspecific portion of the audio about someone having “f---ed up.” Langley argues\\n\\nthe jury may have interpreted this statement as relevant to Langley’s actions the\\n\\nfollowing day. Langley did not specifically object to the video’s audio or request\\n\\nat any point that the audio be removed when the video was played.\\n\\n             Upon careful review of the jail video call, as played before the jury\\n\\nduring Det. Isonhood’s and Major Payne’s testimony, and with the convenience of\\n\\nbeing able to play it multiple times, it is quite difficult to identify the portion of the\\n\\naudio to which Langley refers. The aforementioned words seem to have occurred\\n\\nduring a portion of the audio that is nearly inaudible. Neither the Commonwealth\\n\\nnor any witness appears to have referred to this nearly inaudible portion of the\\n\\nvideorecording.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           -25-\\n\\x0c             The audio was relevant; statements made by Langley during the\\n\\nconversation corroborated testimony concerning Langley’s living arrangements, as\\n\\nwell as his relationship with minors at 131 Clay Street. The probative value of the\\n\\naudio outweighed any prejudice to Druin, particularly since it is doubtful the jury\\n\\ncould even hear the allegedly prejudicial statement about someone having f—ed\\n\\nup.\\n\\n             We certainly do not detect any error so palpable and so fundamental\\n\\nthat it threatened the integrity of the judicial process in the trial court allowing the\\n\\nvideo to play with audio. See Brewer, 206 S.W.3d at 349; Martin v.\\n\\nCommonwealth, 207 S.W.3d 1, 5 (Ky. 2006).\\n\\n2. Testimony of Det. Isonhood\\n\\n             Next, Langley argues Det. Isonhood “interpreted” the video and was\\n\\nnot testifying from personal knowledge and thereby usurped the function of the\\n\\njury as the ultimate finder of fact. See Gordon v. Commonwealth, 916 S.W.2d 176,\\n\\n179-80 (Ky. 1995). The Commonwealth argues Det. Isonhood’s initial testimony\\n\\nwas not interpretive, in the sense that it was responsive to the Commonwealth’s\\n\\nquestions, requesting he describe the steps of his investigation. See Cuzick v.\\n\\nCommonwealth, 276 S.W.3d 260, 266 (Ky. 2009) (“Narrative testimony is not\\n\\nnecessarily interpretive testimony[.]”). Any testimony which was interpretive, the\\n\\nCommonwealth argues, was solicited by the defense during cross-examination and\\n\\n                                          -26-\\n\\x0cthe errors, if any, were invited. Robertson v. Commonwealth, 677 S.W.3d 309, 318\\n\\n(Ky. 2023) (citations omitted) (“A party is estopped from asserting an invited error\\n\\non appeal.”).\\n\\n              No objection regarding Det. Isonhood’s testimony about the video\\n\\noccurred at trial. The primary “interpretation” Langley identifies having occurred\\n\\nin Det. Isonhood’s testimony is that concerning the gun seen in the video and its\\n\\ncharacteristics. Most of Det. Isonhood’s testimony regarding the jail video call did\\n\\noccur during cross-examination.\\n\\n              About a minute and a half of the video was played in front of the jury,\\n\\nwithout interruption, near the end of Det. Isonhood’s direct examination. After the\\n\\nvideo played, the Commonwealth asked him whether the video was the same one\\n\\nhe’d referred to in his testimony and he affirmed it was. Prior to the playing of the\\n\\nvideo, Det. Isonhood had described confronting Langley during questioning on\\n\\nAugust 15, 2022, and telling Langley a gun could be observed in the room during\\n\\nthe jail call video.\\n\\n              The only significant descriptions of the video’s contents by Det.\\n\\nIsonhood during direct examination occurred during his recollections of describing\\n\\nthe video to Langley. These were his accounts of telling Langley that after his\\n\\n“camera pans – there is a gun there” and that “you’re standing here and there’s a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -27-\\n\\x0cdoor behind you and a closet behind you and there’s a bed right here. You pan and\\n\\nthere’s a gun.”\\n\\n             On cross-examination, defense counsel initially questioned Det.\\n\\nIsonhood about a still shot from the video, showing the handgun. This included a\\n\\nseries of questions regarding his opinion on the handgun and whether it matched\\n\\nwitness descriptions of the gun in the shooting. Det. Isonhood testified the gun\\n\\nappeared silver to him but conceded it might be fairly described as dark silver or\\n\\ngrey, at the particular camera angle and lighting. Following this, defense counsel\\n\\nplayed a portion of the video which had been slowed down, then continued to ask\\n\\nDet. Isonhood for opinions on the appearance of the gun in the video. This\\n\\nincluded a line of questioning on whether the gun in the video appeared “smooth”\\n\\nat the top or whether grooves consistent with those drawn by Druin could be seen.\\n\\nDet. Isonhood testified the top was difficult to see well enough to judge. He\\n\\nconceded that not all of the gun’s barrel could be seen at any point past the trigger\\n\\nguard. He conceded he could not say with any certainty that the gun in the video\\n\\nwas not an air pistol but repeated that Langley had never asserted to him that the\\n\\ngun in the video was an air pistol and had only denied ownership.\\n\\n             Generally, the testimony of a lay witness is limited to matters or facts\\n\\nabout which he has personal knowledge. See KRE 602; KRE 701; Toler v. Süd-\\n\\nChemie, Inc., 458 S.W.3d 276, 287 (Ky. 2014); Martin v. Commonwealth, 13\\n\\n                                         -28-\\n\\x0cS.W.3d 232, 235 (Ky. 1999). During Det. Isonhood’s direct examination\\n\\ntestimony on this subject, no objections occurred. Det. Isonhood appeared careful\\n\\nwhen testimony turned to the subject of the jail call video and hesitant to express\\n\\nopinions about its contents. Within the narrative of his questioning Langley, Det.\\n\\nIsonhood did not describe anything that was not captured in the video recording\\n\\nitself, which the jurors were able to watch and interpret independently. Boyd v.\\n\\nCommonwealth, 439 S.W.3d 126, 132 (Ky. 2014). If any error occurred during\\n\\nDet. Isonhood’s direct examination, it was certainly not palpable and so\\n\\nfundamental that it threatened the integrity of the judicial process. See Brewer,\\n\\n206 S.W.3d at 349; Martin, 207 S.W.3d at 5.\\n\\n             The majority of Det. Isonhood’s testimony regarding the contents of\\n\\nthe jail video call did occur on cross-examination. Det. Isonhood had expressed no\\n\\nopinions on whether the gun in the video was consistent with witness descriptions\\n\\nof the gun used in the shooting incident until he was cross-examined. Up to that\\n\\npoint, the only references to the gun in the jail call video occurred within\\n\\nstatements he recalled making to Langley. No opinions regarding the gun in the\\n\\nvideo’s likely caliber or its appearances had been expressed prior to defense\\n\\ncounsel’s cross-examination of Det. Isonhood. “A party is estopped from asserting\\n\\nan invited error on appeal.” Robertson v.

Langley (“Langley”) was\\n\\nconvicted by Henderson Circuit Court of first-degree robbery, possession of a\\n\\nhandgun by a convicted felon, intimidating a participant in the legal process, and\\n\\ntwo counts of first-degree wanton endangerment. He received a total sentence of\\n\\nfifteen years’ imprisonment. Langley appeals his conviction as a matter of right,\\n\\nasserting trial errors. We affirm.\\n\\x0c                                      FACTS\\n\\n             Langley was nineteen years old on August 12, 2022, when he was\\n\\narrested for possession of a handgun by a convicted felon and first-degree wanton\\n\\nendangerment. The Henderson Police Department (“HPD”) arrested Langley after\\n\\nan investigation into a shooting. Said shooting had taken place just over two\\n\\nweeks prior and about two miles away from the scene of Langley’s arrest.\\n\\n             The afternoon of July 28, 2022, around 3:15 p.m., members of HPD\\n\\nresponded to a “shots fired” dispatch at 1424 Woodland Drive in Henderson, the\\n\\naddress of Woodsview Apartments (“Woodsview”). Woodsview is an apartment\\n\\ncomplex consisting of 68 units situated on or near the southern end of Woodland\\n\\nDrive, which ends in a cul-de-sac. The manager of Woodsview would testify that\\n\\ngenerally, a little less than 200 residents are occupying the apartments at a given\\n\\ntime, with at least half of them minor children.\\n\\n             Investigators arriving at the scene found evidence of shots fired into\\n\\napartment #9. Officers who initially arrived gained access inside from Woodsview\\n\\nmanagement, cleared the apartment, and confirmed no resident there had been\\n\\nhome. During their sweep, the officers observed multiple bullet holes to the walls\\n\\nand fixtures inside. One bullet had passed through the walls into an adjoining\\n\\napartment.\\n\\n             Five shell casings, all from a .380 caliber firearm, were located,\\n\\n                                         -2-\\n\\x0cphotographed, and collected outside apartment #9. Three bullet holes visible in\\n\\napartment #9’s windows were photographed. The bullet hole into the adjacent unit\\n\\nwas documented and photographed from the stairway of apartment #10, where it\\n\\nhad entered. Also found on the same stairway was a projectile HPD determined\\n\\nwas a .380 caliber bullet. Officers took statements from witnesses on the scene,\\n\\nincluding Woodsview employees and residents.\\n\\n             Woodsview’s manager, Christine Payne (“Payne”), gave investigating\\n\\nofficers access to surveillance video recorded from the front office on Woodland\\n\\nDrive. Payne would later testify that many neighborhood children were out and\\n\\nabout that day, at and near the scene, because the shooting occurred midday during\\n\\nthe summer. Several children had immediately described to her the shooting and\\n\\nthe direction of the car the shots had been fired from. Investigating officers first\\n\\nviewed the video in the front office alongside minors who had witnessed the\\n\\nshooting. These witnesses pointed out a red Chevrolet HHR in the surveillance\\n\\nvideo as the gunfire’s source. Several distinct features of the HHR – including\\n\\nblack rims, a black grill, a spoiler, and a small white stripe – were identifiable in\\n\\nthe images. Immediate efforts to locate the HHR were unsuccessful.\\n\\n             In the days following, Det. Jake Isonhood, who led HPD’s\\n\\ninvestigation, located an image of a red HHR captured in a video taken by a Flock\\n\\ncamera (a license plate recognition system) in Evansville, Indiana. The vehicle\\n\\n                                          -3-\\n\\x0cwas recorded traveling southbound in Evansville on July 28, 2022, at 11:45 a.m.,\\n\\nroughly three-and-a-half hours prior to the shooting. Details and features of the\\n\\nvehicle matched those of the HHR in the Woodsview surveillance video.\\n\\nRetrieving license plate information, Det. Isonhood found the HHR was registered\\n\\nto Devin Druin (“Druin”) in Evansville.\\n\\n             On August 5, 2002, after tracking Druin down, Det. Isonhood\\n\\naccompanied another officer to Druin’s attorney’s office where Druin’s recorded\\n\\nstatement was taken. At that time, Druin identified Langley as the shooter in the\\n\\nincident. He also alleged Langley had stolen his wallet just after the shooting and\\n\\nhad threatened him with retaliation if Druin broke his silence.\\n\\n             Druin told investigating officers he saw the handgun Langley used\\n\\nand believed it was a .380 caliber. After his recorded statement, Druin provided\\n\\nHPD with a pencil drawing depicting his recollection of Langley’s handgun.\\n\\nAdditionally, Druin provided an account statement showing declined charges from\\n\\na company called Jp Taxi. The card associated with this account had been in\\n\\nDruin’s wallet when Langley took it, the charges had been attempted after the\\n\\nshooting, and Druin had not authorized them, according to Druin.\\n\\n             Even prior to Druin’s recorded statement, Detective Isonhood had\\n\\nreceived a tip from another source identifying the shooter as Langley. This led him\\n\\nto obtain and view a video from the Henderson County Detention Center\\n\\n                                          -4-\\n\\x0c(“HCDC”) recorded July 27, 2022, the day prior to the shooting. Depicted therein\\n\\nwas a “visit” Langley made to an HCDC inmate, by videoconference, with\\n\\nLangley calling from a remote location. The jail call video showed a split screen\\n\\nwith the HCDC inmate’s face and torso on the left side on the screen and Langley\\n\\non the right. Langley’s hair is styled in a tall Afro in the video. On multiple\\n\\noccasions during the video call, Langley moved the camera he was using from his\\n\\nown face and pointed it toward different parts of the room he was in. For a couple\\n\\nof moments, during these points, what appears to be a handgun on top of a piece of\\n\\nfurniture comes into Langley’s camera’s view.\\n\\n             The jail video call begins with Langley and the inmate exchanging\\n\\ngreetings, after which the inmate asks, “where you at?” and Langley responds,\\n\\n“I’m at my spot . . . my crib.” After this, the inmate asks Langley for a “house\\n\\ntour” and Langley briefly moves his camera to pan around the room. At one point,\\n\\nthe inmate asks Langley who the person in the room with him is and Langley\\n\\nresponds, “that’s my girl.” At the inmate’s request, Langley points the camera\\n\\ntoward a bed beside him and a young woman can briefly be seen.\\n\\n             After he was located and arrested by HPD, Langley was eventually\\n\\nindicted for first-degree robbery, possession of a handgun by a felon, first-degree\\n\\nwanton endangerment, and intimidating a participant in a legal process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -5-\\n\\x0c                 A trial took place on May 25, 2023, in a bifurcated guilt-phase\\n\\nproceeding; the jury was not asked to consider the felon in possession of a handgun\\n\\ncharges initially. The errors alleged by Langley as the basis for his appeal\\n\\noccurred during the initial guilt phase. Langley did not testify, and the defense put\\n\\non no proof after the Commonwealth rested. The Commonwealth called numerous\\n\\nwitnesses including employees of Woodsview and several officers from HPD who\\n\\nresponded to the dispatch.\\n\\nTrial Testimony of Woodsview Residents\\n\\n                 Adam Clark (“Clark”), who lived in apartment #10, described how he\\n\\nand his wife Marion were at home napping when they were awakened by the\\n\\ngunfire. Clark said he had found the bullet hole in his stairway through a wall\\n\\nadjacent to apartment #9 just after he awoke to the gunfire. Although Clark and\\n\\nhis wife were home alone at the time, Clark said their young son often played on\\n\\nthe stairway when the couple’s children were home.\\n\\n                 Two young men who resided in Woodsview, Eric Ponder and S.M.,1\\n\\ntestified. Both had given statements to HPD on the day of the shooting. Neither\\n\\nsaw the shots being fired, both heard the shots, then observed a red SUV-type\\n\\nvehicle fleeing. Both saw a white male in the driver’s seat and a black male in the\\n\\npassenger seat. Ponder, who was walking back to Woodsview after playing\\n\\n\\n1\\n    Names of witnesses who were minors at the time of the trial are indicated by initials.\\n                                                  -6-\\n\\x0cbasketball when he heard the shots, described seeing a “silverish” gun held by the\\n\\nblack male. On cross-examination, he described his line of vision on the gun as\\n\\nbeing through the vehicle’s windshield. S.M. described running from his\\n\\napartment after hearing the shots and seeing the red SUV. He described being able\\n\\nto see that the black male was holding a “small silver pistol.” S.M. said the black\\n\\nmale was wearing a hoodie and described his hair as “an Afro.”\\n\\nTrial Testimony of Det. Jake Isonhood\\n\\n              Det. Isonhood was the final member of HPD to testify during the\\n\\ninitial guilt phase. He described the investigation and his own efforts to locate the\\n\\nred HHR, and then Druin. The recorded statement Druin gave was briefly\\n\\ndiscussed. At that point in the investigation, Det. Isonhood believed Langley’s jail\\n\\ncall video had been made from a house at 131 Clay Street in Henderson, and he\\n\\ntook a photo of the house to Druin’s recorded statement. Det. Isonhood described\\n\\nthe investigation, including his taking a statement from Melissa Easley, who\\n\\nresided at 131 Clay Street, on August 15, 2022. Additionally, he took statements\\n\\nat Henderson County schools, on August 24th and 25th of 2022 from H.N.2 and\\n\\nM.E., both minors who resided at 131 Clay Street. In response to an inquiry about\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  H.N. was named as a witness by the Commonwealth and was even mentioned in opening\\nstatements. However, for reasons which do not appear in the record before us, she did not\\ntestify.\\n                                              -7-\\n\\x0cH.N., Det. Isonhood stated she was the person in the room with Langley on the jail\\n\\ncall video.\\n\\n              The detective went on to describe his questioning Langley on August\\n\\n12, 2022. He began with asking Langley where he was currently staying and\\n\\nLangley asserted he had no fixed address. Det. Isonhood asked Langley if he had\\n\\never hung around at 131 Clay Street or known anyone there and he described\\n\\nLangley saying he “promised” he had not. After Det. Isonhood showed him a\\n\\nphotograph of the house, Langley admitted to having been there but not within a\\n\\ncouple of months. After being confronted with further information about Easley,\\n\\nLangley admitted he had stayed there but had already moved out before the time of\\n\\nthe shooting.\\n\\n              Det. Isonhood described showing Langley a photo of Druin’s HHR\\n\\nfrom the Flock video and telling him the vehicle’s owner identified him as the\\n\\nshooter. Langley told him he “did not shoot a gun.” At that point, Det. Isonhood\\n\\nsaid he “brought up the jail video visit” and described to Langley that when his\\n\\n“camera pans – there is a gun there.” Det. Isonhood said Langley told him he\\n\\ndidn’t have a gun, so he “went over the visit again” and said to Langley “you’re\\n\\nstanding here and there’s a door behind you and a closet behind you and there’s a\\n\\nbed right here. You pan and there’s a gun. And [Langley’s] response was, well\\n\\nthat’s not mine though.” As he described pressing Langley further, Det. Isonhood\\n\\n                                        -8-\\n\\x0csaid he “did not deny existence” of a gun in the room with him, he “just denied\\n\\nownership.”\\n\\nTrial Testimony of Devin Druin\\n\\n              Druin was twenty years old when he testified at Langley’s trial. On\\n\\nJuly 28, 2022, Druin had driven from Evansville to 131 Clay Street in Henderson,\\n\\nplanning to smoke marijuana with a female acquaintance. After arriving there,\\n\\nDruin was introduced to Langley, who told him he was “cousins with” Druin’s\\n\\nolder brother. Druin testified this prompted him to phone his older brother, who\\n\\nconfirmed Langley was his cousin. Following this, the pair, along with several\\n\\nfemales, smoked marijuana and talked for a period. Eventually, Langley told\\n\\nDruin he wanted to go to see his daughter and asked for a ride to do this. Druin,\\n\\ndespite having only just met Langley, thought he “seemed like a nice person” and\\n\\nso he agreed. Following Langley’s directions, he drove until they arrived at\\n\\nWoodsview, where he circled two or three times at Langley’s request, before being\\n\\ndirected to stop.\\n\\n              As he came to a stop, Druin recalled, his sight was focused upon “kids\\n\\nin the middle of the road.” Immediately upon reaching a full stop, he heard gunfire\\n\\nand believed they were being shot at, which caused him to speed off in a panic.\\n\\nWhile making his first turn onto the “main road,” Druin explained, he looked over\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -9-\\n\\x0cto see that Langley was okay. At that time, he saw Langley had a gun in his right\\n\\nhand.\\n\\n             Druin testified smoke was still coming from the barrel when he first\\n\\nlaid eyes on the gun. Druin said he was familiar with guns and believed the gun he\\n\\nsaw in Langley’s hand was a .380. He said he only saw the top of the gun and it\\n\\nwas “silver,” later describing it as having a “silver slide.” In the drawing Druin\\n\\nprovided, he had drawn grooves at the top of the gun.\\n\\n             Upon seeing the gun, Druin yelled, “what the f--- bro!?!” to which\\n\\nLangley commanded he “shut up and keep driving.” Druin complied and drove\\n\\nLangley to a directed location. As Druin stopped for Langley to get out, Langley\\n\\ndisplayed Druin’s wallet he had taken from an open center compartment, saying to\\n\\nDruin, “if you tell anybody, I know where you live.” Druin affirmed on redirect he\\n\\nhad felt intimidated by Langley at this time.\\n\\n             After he left Langley, Druin immediately called his father, who told\\n\\nhim to go home. Druin said he did not call the police because of fear for his\\n\\nyounger sister. Asked to explain, Druin said he did not live at the address which\\n\\nwould be found in his wallet; that address referred to his mother’s house, where his\\n\\nsister lived. He did not want “to put her in harm’s way.” When asked to explain\\n\\nthis further, Druin alluded to his own older brother associating with a group he\\n\\navoided as they were violent.\\n\\n                                        -10-\\n\\x0c             For the next few days, Druin tried to put the incident out of his mind\\n\\nand act as though nothing happened. This came to an end when he received a\\n\\nmessage from his father that his vehicle had “been on the news” in connection with\\n\\na shooting. Druin, along with his mother, took steps to contact HPD and arranged\\n\\nto give an interview. This was soon rescheduled to a short time later, after his\\n\\nconsulting with an attorney.\\n\\nTestimony of Melissa Easley\\n\\n             Melissa Easley was the final witness to testify in the initial guilt\\n\\nphase. Easley testified she knew Langley as a friend of her kids who was staying\\n\\nin her home, on 131 Clay Street, in July 2022. Easley had let Langley move in\\n\\nbecause he “needed a place to go.” She “threw him out” after finding him “in bed\\n\\nwith a sixteen-year-old girl” and deciding he was “too friendly with the kids.”\\n\\nEasley’s daughter, M.E., and H.N. were both living with her at this time. Easley’s\\n\\nboyfriend, Stevie Davis, was also living there. Davis, Easley confirmed, was\\n\\nemployed by Jp Taxi in July of 2022.\\n\\n             Asked about Druin, Easley described an occasion she encountered\\n\\nhim in her home and “kicked him out.” She described “throwing out” both Druin\\n\\nand Langley at this time. Upon careful review of her testimony, Easley appears to\\n\\ndescribe this as part of the same event for which she evicted Langley. Both parties\\n\\nseemed to question Easley under an initial presumption that the encounter she\\n\\n                                         -11-\\n\\x0cdescribed occurred the same day as the shooting. However, Easley indicated she\\n\\nknew nothing of the shooting at the time and could not say this encounter occurred\\n\\nthe same day. Easley did recall her encounter with Druin occurred upon her arrival\\n\\nhome from work.\\n\\n             On cross-examination, Easley said she had worked different shifts\\n\\nduring this period but believed her shift, on the day she encountered Druin, would\\n\\nhave put her arrival home sometime between 6 and 7 p.m. Immediately afterward,\\n\\nshe agreed to the defense’s estimate of 4 to 6 p.m. On redirect, she conceded she\\n\\nmay have been working a different shift altogether and could have arrived home\\n\\nsignificantly earlier in the day (and prior to the time of the shooting). Near the\\n\\nclose of her testimony, Easley made clear she could not commit to her encounter\\n\\nwith Druin even taking place the same date as the Woodsview shooting. She put it\\n\\nclose in time but said it could have well been another day entirely.\\n\\n             Easley said she found a wallet in her basement that she knew was\\n\\nDruin’s because his I.D. was in it. Easley’s daughter and boyfriend both made\\n\\ncalls to Druin in efforts to get his wallet back to him, she said, but Druin never\\n\\ncame to retrieve it. Easley was unsure about the length of time after her encounter\\n\\nwith Druin before she found his wallet. She described it being “right after” at one\\n\\npoint and “maybe a day or two” later, at another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -12-\\n\\x0c             Shown a still image from the jail video call, Easley confirmed the\\n\\nroom Langley was in looked like an upstairs bedroom of 131 Clay Street.\\n\\nExamining another still image from the jail video call, with the person in the bed\\n\\nbeside Langley visible, Easley testified it “could be my daughter or maybe [H.N.].”\\n\\n             In closing arguments, Langley, by counsel, argued the shooter was, in\\n\\nfact, Druin. Easley’s testimony established Druin had returned to 131 Clay Street\\n\\nafter the shooting and demonstrated no fear of Langley. Furthermore, Langley\\n\\nargued, Easley’s account showed Langley had not taken Druin’s wallet; Druin\\n\\nsimply left it behind. He argued the testimony of Eric Ponder, who said he could\\n\\nsee the gun through the HHR’s windshield, was more consistent with the gun\\n\\nhaving been in Druin’s hand, rather than in Langley’s. The “gun” seen near\\n\\nLangley in the jail video call, he argued, could as well have been an air pistol.\\n\\nLangley asserted the gun in the video appeared smooth on top, was not shiny, and\\n\\nwas darker in color than witness descriptions of the gun used in the Woodsview\\n\\nshooting.\\n\\n             Despite Langley’s arguments, the jury found him guilty of first-degree\\n\\nrobbery, first-degree wanton endangerment (two counts), intimidating a participant\\n\\nin the legal process, and possession of a handgun by a convicted felon. The jury\\n\\nrecommended a total sentence of fifteen (15) years in prison, and the trial court\\n\\nsentenced Langley consistently with this recommendation. Langley appeals from\\n\\n                                         -13-\\n\\x0chis conviction and sentence. Further facts will be developed as necessary.\\n\\n                                       ANALYSIS\\n\\n                We begin our review on the instances of preserved error, first with the\\n\\ndenial of Langley’s motion for a directed verdict.\\n\\n                                   I. Directed Verdict\\n\\n                At the close of the Commonwealth’s proof, defense made a motion for\\n\\na directed verdict of acquittal on the charge of first-degree robbery. Langley\\n\\nalleges the trial court’s denial of this motion was reversible error.\\n\\n                For our standard of review, “the test of a directed verdict is, if under\\n\\nthe evidence as a whole, it would be clearly unreasonable for a jury to find guilt,\\n\\nonly then the defendant is entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal.”\\n\\nCommonwealth v.

In particular, he argues the Commonwealth failed to prove he\\n\\nthreatened the immediate use of physical force upon Druin to accomplish the theft\\n\\nof his wallet.\\n\\n             Langley points out Druin’s testimony was the substantive basis of the\\n\\nfirst-degree robbery charge. Per Druin’s allegations, Langley did not point the gun\\n\\nat him when he took his wallet. Druin conceded Langley made no specific\\n\\nreferences to having a gun. Furthermore, Druin conceded Langley made no\\n\\nexplicit threat of immediate harm when taking the wallet, only saying, “if you tell\\n\\nanyone, I know where you live.”\\n                                        -15-\\n\\x0c              Robbery in the first degree, as defined in KRS 515.020(1), is an\\n\\naggravated form of robbery, containing all of the elements of robbery in the second\\n\\ndegree,4 with the addition of one of three possible aggravating factors. The jury in\\n\\nLangley’s trial was instructed under KRS 515.020(1)(b), requiring a finding only\\n\\nthat Langley was armed with a deadly weapon, during a theft, which he\\n\\naccomplished by threat of immediate physical force. The Commonwealth was not\\n\\nrequired to prove that Langley threatened Druin with the handgun in his\\n\\npossession, but only that Langley threatened the use of immediate physical force.\\n\\n              Langley acknowledges the statement Druin described that “if you tell\\n\\nanybody, I know where you live” might be reasonably interpreted by the jury as “a\\n\\nveiled, conditional, future threat of some harm if Druin told anyone about the\\n\\nincident.” (Emphasis added.) Langley argues this threat of future harm was the\\n\\nonly one in evidence and it was insufficient for the jury to find a threat of\\n\\nimmediate physical force.\\n\\n              Such an argument implies Druin’s testimony described, at most, a\\n\\ntheft accomplished solely by a threat of physical force in the future – extortion\\n\\nrather than robbery. However, the Commonwealth argued at trial it was\\n\\nunnecessary for Langley to brandish the firearm, or explicitly reference it, to\\n\\n\\n4\\n KRS 515.030(1) defines robbery in the second degree: “A person is guilty of robbery in the\\nsecond degree when, in the course of committing theft, he or she uses or threatens the immediate\\nuse of physical force upon another person with intent to accomplish the theft.”\\n                                             -16-\\n\\x0cestablish he used a threat of force to accomplish the theft. Evidence supported a\\n\\nfinding that Langley’s threat of immediate physical force was conveyed implicitly,\\n\\nrather than explicitly voiced. Druin’s testimony indicated he knew Langley was in\\n\\npossession of a firearm that, very shortly beforehand, he had fired into an\\n\\napartment in a densely populated area, and that Druin had felt intimidated by\\n\\nLangley when Langley took Druin’s wallet.\\n\\n              Confronted with a motion for directed verdict, the trial court must\\n\\nassume the truth of the Commonwealth’s evidence and “draw all fair and\\n\\nreasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the Commonwealth.”\\n\\nCommonwealth v.

HPD was\\n\\nunable to locate the firearm used in the shooting and the video was substantive\\n\\nevidence that Langley had access to a handgun and the opportunity to possess one\\n\\nthe day prior to the shooting.

However, Druin\\n\\ntestified the handgun had a “silver slide,” the eyewitnesses to Druin and Langley\\n\\nfleeing described the gun as “silverish” and a “small silver pistol.” The\\n\\nCommonwealth argued the gun shown on the video resembled these descriptions\\n\\nand Druin’s drawing. Langley’s arguments about the gun’s appearance greatly\\n\\ndiffering from Druin’s description and drawing were presented to the jury.\\n\\n            Having viewed the jail video call, we conclude a jury could\\n\\nreasonably infer the handgun in the video matched the descriptions of the gun\\n\\nused in the shooting and that the video demonstrated Langley’s access to it. It is\\n\\nclear the evidence was sufficiently probative to warrant its introduction into\\n\\nevidence under standards discussed in Leach, 571 S.W.3d at 554.\\n\\n            Finally, this evidence was not unduly prejudicial, and its potential for\\n\\nprejudice did not substantially outweigh its probative value. Evidence is only\\n\\nunduly prejudicial if it “produces an emotional response that inflames the passions\\n\\nof the triers of fact or is used for an improper purpose.” Id. (citation omitted).

Audio on the Jail Call\\n\\n             Langley argues the trial court should have removed the audio from the\\n\\njail call video because the audio was unduly prejudicial.

Prior to the playing of the\\n\\nvideo, Det.

This included a\\n\\nseries of questions regarding his opinion on the handgun and whether it matched\\n\\nwitness descriptions of the gun in the shooting. Det. Isonhood testified the gun\\n\\nappeared silver to him but conceded it might be fairly described as dark silver or\\n\\ngrey, at the particular camera angle and lighting. Following this, defense counsel\\n\\nplayed a portion of the video which had been slowed down, then continued to ask\\n\\nDet. Isonhood for opinions on the appearance of the gun in the video. This\\n\\nincluded a line of questioning on whether the gun in the video appeared “smooth”\\n\\nat the top or whether grooves consistent with those drawn by Druin could be seen.\\n\\nDet. Isonhood testified the top was difficult to see well enough to judge. He\\n\\nconceded that not all of the gun’s barrel could be seen at any point past the trigger\\n\\nguard. He conceded he could not say with any certainty that the gun in the video\\n\\nwas not an air pistol but repeated that Langley had never asserted to him that the\\n\\ngun in the video was an air pistol and had only denied ownership.\\n\\n             Generally, the testimony of a lay witness is limited to matters or facts\\n\\nabout which he has personal knowledge.

(“Mother”) appeals from the involuntary\\n\\ntermination of her parental rights to M.K.W. (“Child”).1 We affirm.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n To protect the minor child’s privacy and pursuant to court practice, we do not refer to the child\\nor the natural parents by name. See also Kentucky Rules of Appellate Procedure (“RAP”)\\n5(B)(2).\\n\\x0c                                      FACTS\\n\\n             Child was born in the fall of 2019. In October 2021, the Cabinet for\\n\\nHealth and Family Services (“the Cabinet”) filed a dependency, neglect, and abuse\\n\\n(“DNA”) petition with a social worker’s affidavit. The social worker averred\\n\\nChild was placed with relatives in a safety plan after Mother was arrested. She\\n\\nalso averred Mother had been threatening the social worker and caregivers.\\n\\n             The family court granted the Cabinet emergency custody of Child and\\n\\nordered Mother to pay child support. Child was placed with a foster family in late\\n\\nOctober 2021 and has remained in the foster family’s home since then.\\n\\n             In January 2022, the family court adjudicated Child to be an abused or\\n\\nneglected child and placed him in the temporary custody of the Cabinet. In May\\n\\n2022, following a disposition hearing, Child was committed to the Cabinet.\\n\\n             The family court ordered Mother to undergo drug testing. It also\\n\\nfound her indigent and ordered the Cabinet to pay for services. Court review notes\\n\\nand Cabinet reports in the DNA case record indicate Mother was required to\\n\\nundergo substance abuse and mental health assessments, obtain mental health\\n\\ntreatment, and attend parenting classes.\\n\\n             In December 2022, the family court entered a permanency order\\n\\nreflecting concurrent goals of both reunification and termination of parental\\n\\nrights/adoption. Following review in June 2023, the family court’s notes state the\\n\\n\\n                                           -2-\\n\\x0cCabinet reported Mother had not fully complied with her case plan requirements\\n\\nand the Cabinet planned to seek termination of parental rights (“TPR”), but Mother\\n\\ncould continue to work her case plan.\\n\\n                 In early September 2023, the Cabinet filed the TPR petition. The case\\n\\nproceeded to trial in February 2024. The family court entered an order terminating\\n\\nMother’s parental rights and supporting findings of fact and conclusions of law in\\n\\nMarch 2024. Mother filed a timely appeal.\\n\\n                 Mother’s counsel filed an Anders brief,2 indicating she perceived no\\n\\nmeritorious grounds for appeal, along with a motion to withdraw. Mother’s\\n\\ncounsel certified that she sent copies of the Anders brief and the motion to\\n\\nwithdraw to Mother at her last known address, along with a letter advising Mother\\n\\nof her right to file a pro se brief.3 This Court entered an order passing Mother’s\\n\\ncounsel’s motion to the merits and giving Mother 30 days to file a supplemental\\n\\npro se brief if she so desired. Mother did not file a supplemental brief.\\n\\n                 Upon review, we grant Mother’s counsel’s motion to withdraw by\\n\\nseparate order and affirm the family court’s termination of Mother’s parental\\n\\nrights. Further facts will be provided as necessary in our analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n    See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1967).\\n3\\n Mother’s counsel noted Mother would not confirm via text message that the address was her\\ncurrent address, but that counsel would attempt to advise her over the phone.\\n\\n                                                 -3-\\n\\x0c                                     ANALYSIS\\n\\n                            Anders Brief Considerations\\n\\n             We set forth the procedure for considering Anders briefs in Kentucky\\n\\ninvoluntary termination of parental rights cases in A.C. v. Cabinet for Health and\\n\\nFamily Services, 362 S.W.3d 361, 371 (Ky. App. 2012).\\n\\n             If counsel concludes there are no proper grounds for appellate relief\\n\\nfrom an involuntary termination of parental rights, counsel must nonetheless\\n\\nsubmit a brief “‘referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the\\n\\nappeal.’” Id. (quoting Anders, 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S. Ct. at 1400). Other than\\n\\nnoting the family court’s finding that Mother did provide some snacks and gifts of\\n\\nclothing to Child at visits, the Anders brief does not refer to anything in the record\\n\\nthat might arguably support the appeal. Nonetheless, we “are obligated to\\n\\nindependently review the record and ascertain whether the appeal is, in fact, void\\n\\nof nonfrivolous grounds for reversal.” A.C., 362 S.W.3d at 372 (citing Anders, 386\\n\\nU.S. at 744, 87 S. Ct. at 1400).\\n\\n             Such review is analogous to a palpable error review, requiring only\\n\\nthat we ascertain whether any error affects the substantial rights of a party. A.C.,\\n\\n362 S.W.3d at 370. If such a review results in the Court’s agreement with an\\n\\nappellant’s counsel that there is no nonfrivolous ground for appealing the\\n\\ntermination of parental rights, it is appropriate to affirm the family court.\\n\\n\\n                                          -4-\\n\\x0cNonetheless, in considering the family court’s decision upon our independent\\n\\nreview of the record, we keep in mind statutory requirements for granting a\\n\\npetition for involuntary termination of parental rights. See id. at 371-72 (noting\\n\\ninvoluntary termination of parental rights “requires strict application of statutory\\n\\nstandards”).\\n\\n      Statutory Requirements for Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights\\n\\n                Before terminating parental rights, the family court must find clear\\n\\nand convincing evidence4 to support each of the three parts of the standard\\n\\nestablished by KRS5 625.090. First, the child must have been found to be an\\n\\n“abused or neglected” child as defined by KRS 600.020(1). KRS 625.090(1)(a).\\n\\nSecond, the family court must find at least one ground of parental unfitness as set\\n\\nforth in KRS 625.090(2). Third, termination must be in the child’s best interest.\\n\\nKRS 625.090(1)(c). In determining the child’s best interest and whether there are\\n\\nground(s) of parental unfitness, the family court must consider the factors listed in\\n\\nKRS 625.090(3).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  Clear and convincing evidence “does not necessarily mean uncontradicted proof. It is\\nsufficient if there is proof of a probative and substantial nature carrying the weight of evidence\\nsufficient to convince ordinarily prudent-minded people.” Commonwealth, Cabinet for Health\\nand Family Services v. T.N.H., 302 S.W.3d 658, 663 (Ky. 2010) (internal quotation marks and\\ncitations omitted).\\n5\\n    Kentucky Revised Statutes.\\n\\n                                                -5-\\n\\x0c     Requirements for Reviewing Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights\\n\\n                “[T]ermination of parental rights is a grave action which the courts\\n\\nmust conduct with utmost caution.” M.S.S. v. J.E.B., 638 S.W.3d 354, 359 (Ky.\\n\\n2022) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). Thus, the evidence to\\n\\nsupport termination must be clear and convincing. KRS 625.090; see also\\n\\nSantosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 769-70, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 1403, 71 L. Ed. 2d\\n\\n599 (1982) (holding due process requires proof by at least clear and convincing\\n\\nevidence for termination of parental rights).\\n\\n                Even so, the decision of a family court to involuntarily terminate\\n\\nparental rights is accorded great deference on appellate review. The family court’s\\n\\nfactual findings are reviewed under the “clearly erroneous” standard of CR6 52.01,7\\n\\nmeaning they shall not be disturbed unless they are not supported by substantial\\n\\nevidence. M.P.S. v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 979 S.W.2d 114, 116 (Ky.\\n\\nApp. 1998). We review the family court’s determination that termination of\\n\\nparental rights is in a child’s best interest for abuse of discretion. D.J.D. v. Cabinet\\n\\nfor Health and Family Services, 350 S.W.3d 833, 837 (Ky. App. 2011).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n    Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure.\\n7\\n CR 52.01 states in pertinent part: “Findings of fact, shall not be set aside unless clearly\\nerroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the\\ncredibility of the witnesses.”\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -6-\\n\\x0c               Family Court Made Statutorily Required Findings\\n\\n             The family court made the findings required in KRS 625.090 by clear\\n\\nand convincing evidence – specifically including 1) Child being an abused or\\n\\nneglected child, 2) at least one ground of parental unfitness, and 3) termination\\n\\nbeing in Child’s best interest. And based upon our review of the record,\\n\\nsubstantial evidence supports the family court’s factual findings on these matters.\\n\\nThe family court also appropriately considered factors listed in KRS 625.090(3)\\n\\nfor assessing whether termination was in Child’s best interest.\\n\\n       No Reversible Error in Family Court’s Finding That Child Was\\n                            Abused or Neglected\\n\\n             The family court noted the prior adjudication that Child was abused or\\n\\nneglected entered in the DNA case in January 2022. The family court also made\\n\\nan independent finding, based on clear and convincing evidence presented at trial,\\n\\nthat Child is an abused or neglected child since Mother failed to make enough\\n\\nprogress on her case plan to allow for Child’s safe return. Specifically, the family\\n\\ncourt found Mother failed to fully comply with case plan requirements for\\n\\nsubstance abuse and mental health treatment, was often sleepy or inattentive at\\n\\nvisits with Child, and had been arrested eleven times since the DNA case was filed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -7-\\n\\x0cMoreover, the family court did not accept Mother’s explanation that difficulties\\n\\nposed by her typical third shift working hours caused all these problems.8\\n\\n               Based on our review of the record, the family court’s findings that\\n\\nChild had previously been adjudicated abused or neglected and remained so based\\n\\non Mother’s lack of full compliance with case plan requirements for permitting\\n\\nChild’s safe return are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly\\n\\nerroneous. Next, we address its findings of grounds of parental unfitness.\\n\\n       No Error in Finding at Least One Ground of Parental Unfitness as\\n                         Set Forth in KRS 625.090(2)\\n\\n               The record adequately supports the family court’s determination that\\n\\nthe Cabinet proved the existence of at least one ground of parental unfitness by\\n\\nclear and convincing evidence. Specifically, the record clearly – even indisputably\\n\\n– supports the family court’s finding of the ground set forth in KRS 625.090(2)(j):\\n\\n“That the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the cabinet for\\n\\nfifteen (15) cumulative months out of forty-eight (48) months preceding the filing\\n\\nof the petition to terminate parental rights[.]”\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n  Though not raised on appeal, Mother’s attorney argued at trial that factors such as Mother’s\\nworking third shift and her lack of transportation hampered her ability to meet case plan\\nrequirements. Nonetheless, we must defer to the family court’s assessments of witness\\ncredibility and the weight of the evidence. See Moore v. Asente, 110 S.W.3d 336, 354 (Ky.\\n2003) (“[J]udging the credibility of witnesses and weighing evidence are tasks within the\\nexclusive province of the trial court.”).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                               -8-\\n\\x0c              Ample evidence in the record shows Child was in Cabinet custody\\n\\nand foster care since late October 2021, about 22 months before the TPR petition\\n\\nwas filed in early September 2023. In short, there is no error in the family court’s\\n\\nfinding of at least one ground of parental unfitness.9 Lastly, we address the family\\n\\ncourt’s best interest determination.\\n\\n       Family Court’s Factual Findings Regarding Child’s Best Interest are\\n    Supported by Substantial Evidence and the Family Court Did Not Abuse its\\n            Discretion in Finding Termination in Child’s Best Interest\\n\\n              The family court quoted KRS 625.090(3) and made findings regarding\\n\\neach best interest factor listed in KRS 625.090(3), namely: 1) mental illness or\\n\\nintellectual disability which would consistently render the parent unable to meet\\n\\nthe child’s needs for extended time periods, 2) acts of abuse or neglect toward any\\n\\nchild in the family, 3) whether the Cabinet made reasonable reunification efforts\\n\\nprior to filing the petition for termination if the child was placed with the Cabinet,\\n\\n4) the parent’s efforts and adjustments in his/her conduct and circumstances to\\n\\nmake a return to the parent’s home in the child’s best interest within a reasonable\\n\\ntime considering the child’s age, 5) the child’s physical, emotional, and mental\\n\\nhealth and prospects for improvement if termination were ordered, and 6) the\\n\\nparent’s payment or failure to pay for a reasonable portion of the child’s care if\\n\\n\\n9\\n The family court also found other grounds of parental unfitness set forth in KRS 625.090(2),\\nbut we need not address whether these other grounds are supported by the evidence since only\\none KRS 625.090(2) ground is required to support termination.\\n\\n                                              -9-\\n\\x0cfinancially able to do so. Other than the first factor, the family court found all\\n\\nfactors favored termination.\\n\\n             Regarding the first factor, the family court found no evidence that\\n\\nMother was properly diagnosed with mental illness or an intellectual disability.\\n\\nRegarding the second factor, the family court found the evidence presented at trial\\n\\nwas sufficient to convince it Child was abused or neglected while in Mother’s care.\\n\\nIt also found Child further neglected because of Mother’s failure to fully comply\\n\\nwith case plan requirements so Child could be safely returned to her custody.\\n\\n             Regarding the third factor, the family court found the Cabinet\\n\\nrendered reasonable reunification efforts by providing appropriate referrals to\\n\\nservices including mental health and substance abuse assessments, parenting\\n\\nclasses, counseling, and supervised visitation. The family court also found that the\\n\\nCabinet proved it offered Mother all reasonable reunification services available in\\n\\nthe community and that it was unlikely further services would bring about a lasting\\n\\nadjustment permitting Child’s safe return. Moreover, it rejected Mother’s assertion\\n\\nthat she could not always take advantage of offered mental health services due to\\n\\nher employment, since the court found Mother’s usual third shift schedule would\\n\\nnot conflict with mental health appointments.\\n\\n             Regarding the fourth factor (about parental efforts and adjustments),\\n\\nthe family court found Mother completed parenting classes and obtained\\n\\n\\n                                         -10-\\n\\x0cemployment but failed to fully comply with substance abuse or mental health\\n\\ntreatment requirements, failed to maintain a suitable home, and to refrain from\\n\\nactivities which led to incarceration. The family court also found Mother quit at\\n\\nleast one job during the proceedings, was arrested several times, and was on\\n\\nprobation. The court also noted the social worker’s testimony that Mother failed to\\n\\ntake personal responsibility and found that Mother’s third shift employment should\\n\\nnot interfere with scheduled visits other than Mother having to adjust her sleep\\n\\nschedule. It found Mother failed to improve her position so that Child could safely\\n\\nbe returned to her care.\\n\\n             Regarding the fifth factor (Child’s health and prospects for\\n\\nimprovement), the family court noted a lack of testimony about Mother’s bond\\n\\nwith Child in contrast to the foster mother’s testimony that Child was adjusting\\n\\nwell and bonded to the foster family. The family court also found indications that\\n\\nChild’s health (especially his mental and emotional health) had improved since he\\n\\ncame to live with his foster family. It also found Child became upset and suffered\\n\\nnight terrors after having visits with Mother based on the foster mother’s\\n\\ntestimony, and it noted that the social worker described Child as much less fearful\\n\\nsince entering foster care. The court further noted the foster mother testified she\\n\\nand her family sought to adopt Child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        -11-\\n\\x0c             Regarding the sixth factor, the family court noted Mother was ordered\\n\\nto pay child support and had made payments for part of her monthly obligation\\n\\nduring the last two months of 2023. However, it found she otherwise had failed to\\n\\npay child support and was in arrears. The family court noted Mother testified to\\n\\nsending letters seeking a child support reduction. But it found that even if Mother\\n\\nwere entitled to a reduction, she would still have a child support obligation; yet,\\n\\nother than the two payments made in late 2023, had failed to make any payments.\\n\\n             Based on our review of the record, the family court’s factual findings\\n\\nregarding best interest considerations are supported by substantial evidence.\\n\\nFurthermore, we discern no abuse of discretion in the family court’s determination\\n\\nthat termination of Mother’s parental rights was in Child’s best interest.\\n\\n             In short, following our independent examination of the record and\\n\\nreview of the family court’s KRS 625.090 findings, “we agree with counsel’s\\n\\nestimation and perceive no basis warranting relief on appeal.” A.C., 362 S.W.3d at\\n\\n372.

See also Kentucky Rules of Appellate Procedure (“RAP”)\\n5(B)(2).\\n\\x0c                                      FACTS\\n\\n             Child was born in the fall of 2019. In October 2021, the Cabinet for\\n\\nHealth and Family Services (“the Cabinet”) filed a dependency, neglect, and abuse\\n\\n(“DNA”) petition with a social worker’s affidavit. The social worker averred\\n\\nChild was placed with relatives in a safety plan after Mother was arrested. She\\n\\nalso averred Mother had been threatening the social worker and caregivers.\\n\\n             The family court granted the Cabinet emergency custody of Child and\\n\\nordered Mother to pay child support. Child was placed with a foster family in late\\n\\nOctober 2021 and has remained in the foster family’s home since then.\\n\\n             In January 2022, the family court adjudicated Child to be an abused or\\n\\nneglected child and placed him in the temporary custody of the Cabinet. In May\\n\\n2022, following a disposition hearing, Child was committed to the Cabinet.\\n\\n             The family court ordered Mother to undergo drug testing. It also\\n\\nfound her indigent and ordered the Cabinet to pay for services. Court review notes\\n\\nand Cabinet reports in the DNA case record indicate Mother was required to\\n\\nundergo substance abuse and mental health assessments, obtain mental health\\n\\ntreatment, and attend parenting classes.\\n\\n             In December 2022, the family court entered a permanency order\\n\\nreflecting concurrent goals of both reunification and termination of parental\\n\\nrights/adoption. Following review in June 2023, the family court’s notes state the\\n\\n\\n                                           -2-\\n\\x0cCabinet reported Mother had not fully complied with her case plan requirements\\n\\nand the Cabinet planned to seek termination of parental rights (“TPR”), but Mother\\n\\ncould continue to work her case plan.\\n\\n                 In early September 2023, the Cabinet filed the TPR petition. The case\\n\\nproceeded to trial in February 2024. The family court entered an order terminating\\n\\nMother’s parental rights and supporting findings of fact and conclusions of law in\\n\\nMarch 2024. Mother filed a timely appeal.\\n\\n                 Mother’s counsel filed an Anders brief,2 indicating she perceived no\\n\\nmeritorious grounds for appeal, along with a motion to withdraw. Mother’s\\n\\ncounsel certified that she sent copies of the Anders brief and the motion to\\n\\nwithdraw to Mother at her last known address, along with a letter advising Mother\\n\\nof her right to file a pro se brief.3 This Court entered an order passing Mother’s\\n\\ncounsel’s motion to the merits and giving Mother 30 days to file a supplemental\\n\\npro se brief if she so desired. Mother did not file a supplemental brief.\\n\\n                 Upon review, we grant Mother’s counsel’s motion to withdraw by\\n\\nseparate order and affirm the family court’s termination of Mother’s parental\\n\\nrights.

And based upon our review of the record,\\n\\nsubstantial evidence supports the family court’s factual findings on these matters.\\n\\nThe family court also appropriately considered factors listed in KRS 625.090(3)\\n\\nfor assessing whether termination was in Child’s best interest.\\n\\n       No Reversible Error in Family Court’s Finding That Child Was\\n                            Abused or Neglected\\n\\n             The family court noted the prior adjudication that Child was abused or\\n\\nneglected entered in the DNA case in January 2022. The family court also made\\n\\nan independent finding, based on clear and convincing evidence presented at trial,\\n\\nthat Child is an abused or neglected child since Mother failed to make enough\\n\\nprogress on her case plan to allow for Child’s safe return. Specifically, the family\\n\\ncourt found Mother failed to fully comply with case plan requirements for\\n\\nsubstance abuse and mental health treatment, was often sleepy or inattentive at\\n\\nvisits with Child, and had been arrested eleven times since the DNA case was filed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -7-\\n\\x0cMoreover, the family court did not accept Mother’s explanation that difficulties\\n\\nposed by her typical third shift working hours caused all these problems.8\\n\\n               Based on our review of the record, the family court’s findings that\\n\\nChild had previously been adjudicated abused or neglected and remained so based\\n\\non Mother’s lack of full compliance with case plan requirements for permitting\\n\\nChild’s safe return are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly\\n\\nerroneous. Next, we address its findings of grounds of parental unfitness.\\n\\n       No Error in Finding at Least One Ground of Parental Unfitness as\\n                         Set Forth in KRS 625.090(2)\\n\\n               The record adequately supports the family court’s determination that\\n\\nthe Cabinet proved the existence of at least one ground of parental unfitness by\\n\\nclear and convincing evidence. Specifically, the record clearly – even indisputably\\n\\n– supports the family court’s finding of the ground set forth in KRS 625.090(2)(j):\\n\\n“That the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the cabinet for\\n\\nfifteen (15) cumulative months out of forty-eight (48) months preceding the filing\\n\\nof the petition to terminate parental rights[.]”\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n  Though not raised on appeal, Mother’s attorney argued at trial that factors such as Mother’s\\nworking third shift and her lack of transportation hampered her ability to meet case plan\\nrequirements.

Other than the first factor, the family court found all\\n\\nfactors favored termination.\\n\\n             Regarding the first factor, the family court found no evidence that\\n\\nMother was properly diagnosed with mental illness or an intellectual disability.\\n\\nRegarding the second factor, the family court found the evidence presented at trial\\n\\nwas sufficient to convince it Child was abused or neglected while in Mother’s care.\\n\\nIt also found Child further neglected because of Mother’s failure to fully comply\\n\\nwith case plan requirements so Child could be safely returned to her custody.\\n\\n             Regarding the third factor, the family court found the Cabinet\\n\\nrendered reasonable reunification efforts by providing appropriate referrals to\\n\\nservices including mental health and substance abuse assessments, parenting\\n\\nclasses, counseling, and supervised visitation. The family court also found that the\\n\\nCabinet proved it offered Mother all reasonable reunification services available in\\n\\nthe community and that it was unlikely further services would bring about a lasting\\n\\nadjustment permitting Child’s safe return. Moreover, it rejected Mother’s assertion\\n\\nthat she could not always take advantage of offered mental health services due to\\n\\nher employment, since the court found Mother’s usual third shift schedule would\\n\\nnot conflict with mental health appointments.\\n\\n             Regarding the fourth factor (about parental efforts and adjustments),\\n\\nthe family court found Mother completed parenting classes and obtained\\n\\n\\n                                         -10-\\n\\x0cemployment but failed to fully comply with substance abuse or mental health\\n\\ntreatment requirements, failed to maintain a suitable home, and to refrain from\\n\\nactivities which led to incarceration. The family court also found Mother quit at\\n\\nleast one job during the proceedings, was arrested several times, and was on\\n\\nprobation. The court also noted the social worker’s testimony that Mother failed to\\n\\ntake personal responsibility and found that Mother’s third shift employment should\\n\\nnot interfere with scheduled visits other than Mother having to adjust her sleep\\n\\nschedule. It found Mother failed to improve her position so that Child could safely\\n\\nbe returned to her care.\\n\\n             Regarding the fifth factor (Child’s health and prospects for\\n\\nimprovement), the family court noted a lack of testimony about Mother’s bond\\n\\nwith Child in contrast to the foster mother’s testimony that Child was adjusting\\n\\nwell and bonded to the foster family. The family court also found indications that\\n\\nChild’s health (especially his mental and emotional health) had improved since he\\n\\ncame to live with his foster family. It also found Child became upset and suffered\\n\\nnight terrors after having visits with Mother based on the foster mother’s\\n\\ntestimony, and it noted that the social worker described Child as much less fearful\\n\\nsince entering foster care. The court further noted the foster mother testified she\\n\\nand her family sought to adopt Child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        -11-\\n\\x0c             Regarding the sixth factor, the family court noted Mother was ordered\\n\\nto pay child support and had made payments for part of her monthly obligation\\n\\nduring the last two months of 2023. However, it found she otherwise had failed to\\n\\npay child support and was in arrears. The family court noted Mother testified to\\n\\nsending letters seeking a child support reduction. But it found that even if Mother\\n\\nwere entitled to a reduction, she would still have a child support obligation; yet,\\n\\nother than the two payments made in late 2023, had failed to make any payments.\\n\\n             Based on our review of the record, the family court’s factual findings\\n\\nregarding best interest considerations are supported by substantial evidence.\\n\\nFurthermore, we discern no abuse of discretion in the family court’s determination\\n\\nthat termination of Mother’s parental rights was in Child’s best interest.\\n\\n             In short, following our independent examination of the record and\\n\\nreview of the family court’s KRS 625.090 findings, “we agree with counsel’s\\n\\nestimation and perceive no basis warranting relief on appeal.” A.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5109584\"><a href=\"/opinion/5281626/ac-v-cabinet-for-health-family-services/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: A.C. v.

After our review, we affirm.\\n\\n             On February 5, 2019, a Boyd County Grand Jury indicted Coldiron on\\n\\nfive counts each of theft by unlawful taking (greater than $500 but less than\\n\\n$10,000); second-degree forgery; and theft of identity of another.\\n\\n             Coldiron subsequently entered a guilty plea. By judgment entered on\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2019, the trial court sentenced Coldiron to five (5) years on each\\n\\x0ccount -- to run concurrently for a total of five (5) years; to 100 days to serve with\\n\\nthe balance probated for five (5) years supervised; and to pay restitution in the\\n\\namount of $4,930.00 through the clerk’s office. On September 30, 2019, the trial\\n\\ncourt also entered an Order of Probation and entered a Payment Order directing the\\n\\nclerk of the Boyd Circuit Court to pay over all sums received to the victim, Pilot\\n\\nFlying J. It also ordered that restitution was to be paid at the rate of $250.00 per\\n\\nmonth beginning 30 days after Defendant’s release from incarceration.\\n\\n                On February 8, 2023, a probation and parole officer filed a Violation\\n\\nof Supervision Report in the Boyd Circuit Court and recommended revocation due\\n\\nto Coldiron’s receiving a new felony conviction on January 17, 2023.\\n\\n                The trial court conducted a final revocation hearing on January 10,\\n\\n2024. Officer Mark Bryant of the Division of Probation and Parole testified.\\n\\nOfficer Bryant testified that Coldiron was currently on probation in two different\\n\\ncases -- the Boyd County case and another in Scott County. Officer Bryant further\\n\\ntestified that with respect to the Boyd County case before us, Coldiron had violated\\n\\nthe terms of his probation. On January 17, 2023, Coldiron received a new felony\\n\\nconviction in Butler County, Ohio. Officer Bryant testified that he was asking that\\n\\nColdiron’s Boyd County probation be revoked. He was not aware that any\\n\\nrestitution payments had been made by Coldiron, and no payments appeared in\\n\\ntheir system.\\n\\n\\n                                           -2-\\n\\x0c             On January 17, 2024, the trial court entered an Order revoking\\n\\nColdiron’s probation as follows in relevant part:\\n\\n                    On September 30, 2019, the Defendant . . . was\\n             sentenced . . . for a total of five (5) years, to serve one\\n             hundred days with the balance probated for a period of\\n             five (5) years. He was also required to pay restitution in\\n             the sum of $4,930.00 at the rate of $250.00 a month. He\\n             has made no payments since entry of the Judgment. On\\n             January 17, 2023, he was convicted of a new felony in\\n             Butler County, Ohio for Theft by Deception while on\\n             probation in this County. Additionally, in June of 2020,\\n             he was convicted of Theft by Deception and Theft of\\n             Identity of Another in Scott County, Kentucky.\\n\\n                    Since the entry of the Judgment in this matter,\\n             Defendant has failed to make any payment toward the\\n             restitution as was Ordered. Further, he has been\\n             convicted of two additional crimes while on probation in\\n             this matter. These facts indicate that he cannot be\\n             properly managed in the community as he does not\\n             comply with the terms and directions of the Judgment\\n             which placed him on probation originally. There is no\\n             indication that he has completed the substance abuse\\n             program which was also required of him. Further, his\\n             continued criminal activity makes him a danger to the\\n             community as a whole. . . . [H]e has continued to\\n             engage of crimes of theft, including repeatedly theft of\\n             identity or by deception.\\n\\n(Emphases added.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -3-\\n\\x0c                 Coldiron appeals. We are mindful of the statutory criteria of KRS1\\n\\n439.3106(1)(a) with regard to revocation of probation. We are governed in our\\n\\nreview by the standard of abuse of discretion.\\n\\n                       We review a trial court’s probation revocation\\n                decision under the deferential abuse of discretion\\n                standard. McClure v. Commonwealth, 457 S.W.3d 728,\\n                730 (Ky. App. 2015). A decision is an abuse of\\n                discretion if it is “arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, or\\n                unsupported by sound legal principles.” Id. (citations\\n                omitted). In short, “we will not hold a trial court to have\\n                abused its discretion unless its decision cannot be located\\n                within the range of permissible decisions allowed by a\\n                correct application of the facts to the law.” Id.\\n\\n                       Kentucky Revised Statute (KRS) 439.3106(1)(a)\\n                requires a court to make two findings before revoking\\n                probation: 1) the supervised individual must be “a\\n                significant risk to prior victims . . . or the community at\\n                large”; and 2) the supervised individual “cannot be\\n                appropriately managed in the community[.]” A court\\n                must make both findings before revoking probation but\\n                retains the discretion to choose whether to revoke\\n                probation or impose lesser sanctions. McClure, 457\\n                S.W.3d at 732; Commonwealth v. Andrews, 448 S.W.3d\\n                773, 780 (Ky. 2014).\\n\\nKendrick v. Commonwealth, 664 S.W.3d 731, 734 (Ky. App. 2023).\\n\\n                Coldiron argues that the trial court abused its discretion in revoking\\n\\nhis probation. He contends that the trial court failed to make sufficient findings\\n\\nand failed to sufficiently explain its reasoning. Coldiron relies upon this Court’s\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n    Kentucky Revised Statutes.\\n\\n                                            -4-\\n\\x0clanguage in Helms v. Commonwealth, 475 S.W.3d 637, 645 (Ky. App. 2015) --\\n\\nthat “perfunctorily reciting the statutory language in KRS 439.3106 is not enough.”\\n\\nHowever, as we explained in Kendrick, supra, that statement is often\\n\\nmisconstrued:\\n\\n                   Kendrick relies on our often misconstrued\\n            statement in another published case that “perfunctorily\\n            reciting the statutory language in KRS 439.3106 is not\\n            enough.” Helms v. Commonwealth, 475 S.W.3d 637,\\n            645 (Ky. App. 2015). Perhaps our language about\\n            perfunctory recitations was imprecise, but Helms does\\n            not afford Kendrick relief.\\n\\n                   In Helms, . . . there was “a complete lack of\\n            evidence” that Helms was “a danger to a prior victim or\\n            to the community and he cannot be appropriately\\n            managed in the community . . . .” Id. We stressed the\\n            insufficient evidence, notwithstanding the trial court’s\\n            perfunctory regurgitation of the findings required by\\n            KRS 439.3106[.]\\n\\n            ...\\n\\n                   In other words, we cannot affirm the revocation of\\n            probation simply because the revocation order contains\\n            the requisite statutory findings. A revocation unsupported\\n            by evidence of record would not be “within the range of\\n            permissible decisions allowed by a correct application of\\n            the facts to the law.” McClure, 457 S.W.3d at 730.\\n            Instead, we may affirm a decision to revoke probation\\n            only if: a) the court made the required findings, and b)\\n            those findings are supported by the record. We\\n            emphatically reiterate that Helms does not mean that\\n            a court must provide detailed explanations for the\\n            findings required by KRS 439.3106.\\n\\nKendrick, 664 S.W.3d at 735 (emphases added).\\n\\n                                        -5-\\n\\x0c             In the case before us, the trial court made the requisite statutory\\n\\nfindings, and those findings are supported by the record. That process was\\n\\nsufficient. We agree with the Commonwealth that the trial court was not required\\n\\nto consider a lesser sanction -- as Coldiron contends. “KRS 439.3106 permits, but\\n\\ndoes not require, a trial court to employ lesser sanctions[.]” McClure, supra, at\\n\\n732.\\n\\n             McClure aptly held:\\n\\n             While KRS 439.3106(1) indubitably requires entry of\\n             two vital findings of fact, it does not do so at the expense\\n             of the trial court’s discretion over the broader matter of\\n             revocation. Accordingly, the importance of certain facts\\n             is not ours to weigh on appeal, but is properly left to the\\n             trial court’s exclusive discretion. Our proper role is\\n             merely to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence and\\n             whether an abuse of the trial court’s discretion occurred.\\n\\nId. at 734 (citation omitted). We have evaluated the sufficiency of the evidence in\\n\\nour review of the record, and we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\\n\\ndiscretion in revoking Coldiron’s probation.\\n\\n             Therefore, we affirm the Order of the Boyd Circuit Court entered on\\n\\nJanuary 17, 2024, revoking Coldiron’s probation.\\n\\n\\n\\n             ALL CONCUR.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -6-\\n\\x0cBRIEFS FOR APPELLANT:     BRIEF FOR APPELLEE:\\n\\nRoy Alyette Durham, II    Russell Coleman\\nFrankfort, Kentucky       Attorney General of Kentucky\\n\\n                          Christopher Henry\\n                          Assistant Attorney General\\n                          Frankfort, Kentucky\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                         -7-\\n\\x0c', 'html': '', 'html_lawbox': '', 'html_columbia': '', 'html_anon_2020': '', 'xml_harvard': '', 'html_with_citations': '<pre class=\"inline\">                 RENDERED: JANUARY 31, 2025; 10:00 A.M.\\n                        NOT TO BE PUBLISHED\\n\\n                Commonwealth of Kentucky\\n                          Court of Appeals\\n                              NO. 2024-CA-0223-MR\\n\\nPHILIP R.

After our review, we affirm.\\n\\n             On February 5, 2019, a Boyd County Grand Jury indicted Coldiron on\\n\\nfive counts each of theft by unlawful taking (greater than $500 but less than\\n\\n$10,000); second-degree forgery; and theft of identity of another.\\n\\n             Coldiron subsequently entered a guilty plea. By judgment entered on\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2019, the trial court sentenced Coldiron to five (5) years on each\\n\\x0ccount -- to run concurrently for a total of five (5) years; to 100 days to serve with\\n\\nthe balance probated for five (5) years supervised; and to pay restitution in the\\n\\namount of $4,930.00 through the clerk’s office. On September 30, 2019, the trial\\n\\ncourt also entered an Order of Probation and entered a Payment Order directing the\\n\\nclerk of the Boyd Circuit Court to pay over all sums received to the victim, Pilot\\n\\nFlying J. It also ordered that restitution was to be paid at the rate of $250.00 per\\n\\nmonth beginning 30 days after Defendant’s release from incarceration.\\n\\n                On February 8, 2023, a probation and parole officer filed a Violation\\n\\nof Supervision Report in the Boyd Circuit Court and recommended revocation due\\n\\nto Coldiron’s receiving a new felony conviction on January 17, 2023.\\n\\n                The trial court conducted a final revocation hearing on January 10,\\n\\n2024. Officer Mark Bryant of the Division of Probation and Parole testified.\\n\\nOfficer Bryant testified that Coldiron was currently on probation in two different\\n\\ncases -- the Boyd County case and another in Scott County. Officer Bryant further\\n\\ntestified that with respect to the Boyd County case before us, Coldiron had violated\\n\\nthe terms of his probation. On January 17, 2023, Coldiron received a new felony\\n\\nconviction in Butler County, Ohio. Officer Bryant testified that he was asking that\\n\\nColdiron’s Boyd County probation be revoked. He was not aware that any\\n\\nrestitution payments had been made by Coldiron, and no payments appeared in\\n\\ntheir system.\\n\\n\\n                                           -2-\\n\\x0c             On January 17, 2024, the trial court entered an Order revoking\\n\\nColdiron’s probation as follows in relevant part:\\n\\n                    On September 30, 2019, the Defendant . . . was\\n             sentenced . . . for a total of five (5) years, to serve one\\n             hundred days with the balance probated for a period of\\n             five (5) years. He was also required to pay restitution in\\n             the sum of $4,930.00 at the rate of $250.00 a month. He\\n             has made no payments since entry of the Judgment. On\\n             January 17, 2023, he was convicted of a new felony in\\n             Butler County, Ohio for Theft by Deception while on\\n             probation in this County. Additionally, in June of 2020,\\n             he was convicted of Theft by Deception and Theft of\\n             Identity of Another in Scott County, Kentucky.\\n\\n                    Since the entry of the Judgment in this matter,\\n             Defendant has failed to make any payment toward the\\n             restitution as was Ordered. Further, he has been\\n             convicted of two additional crimes while on probation in\\n             this matter. These facts indicate that he cannot be\\n             properly managed in the community as he does not\\n             comply with the terms and directions of the Judgment\\n             which placed him on probation originally. There is no\\n             indication that he has completed the substance abuse\\n             program which was also required of him. Further, his\\n             continued criminal activity makes him a danger to the\\n             community as a whole. . . . [H]e has continued to\\n             engage of crimes of theft, including repeatedly theft of\\n             identity or by deception.\\n\\n(Emphases added.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         -3-\\n\\x0c                 Coldiron appeals.
